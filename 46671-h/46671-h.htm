<p>Henrie prince of Wales, son and heire to K. Henrie the fourth, borne in Wales
at Monmouth on the riuer of Wie, after his father was departed, tooke vpon
him the regiment of this realme of England, the twentith of March, the morrow after
proclamed king, by the name of Henrie the fift, in the yeare of the world 5375,
after the birth of our sauior, by our account 1413, the third of the emperor Sigismund:
the thr&eacute;e and thirtith of Charles the sixt French king, and in the seuenth yeare of
gouernance in Scotland vnder Robert brother to him that (before entrance into his
kingdome 1390) had Iohn to name, which by deuise and order of the states was
changed into Robert the third, who at Rotsaie (a towne in the Iland of Got, 1406)
deceassed by occasion thus. As vpon hope in this gouernor to himselfe conceiued
how to come to the crowne, he at the castell of Falkland, latelie had famisht his
coosine Dauid the kings elder sonne and heire (a dissolute yoong prince) yet to
his fathers exc&eacute;eding sorrow, at whose deceasse the father verie carefull, and casting
for the safegard of Iames his yoonger son and heire, from Basse the rocke in a well
appointed ship, vnder charge of Henrie Saintcl&eacute;ere earle of Orkeneie, into France
to his old fr&eacute;end king Charles for good education and safetie this yoong prince
he sent: who in the course, whether for tempest or tendernes of stomach, tooke
land in Yorkeshire at Flamborrow, that after by wisedome and good consideration
of the king and his councell was thought verie necessarie here to be reteined. But
by the sudden newes of this staie, the father (at supper as he sat) so stroken at
hart that well nie straight had he fallen downe dead, yet borne into his chamber,
where for gr&eacute;efe and pine within thr&eacute;e daies next he deceassed. The yoong king
Iames his sonne after an eight&eacute;ene yeares staie, in which time he had b&eacute;ene well
trained in princehood, at last with right honorable marriage at saint Marie Oueries
vnto Ione daughter to the earle of Summerset, coosine vnto Henrie the sixt then
king, and with manie other high gratuities here beside was sent and set in his rule and
kingdome at home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Homage doone to K. Henrie before his coronation.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>In Angl. pr&aelig;l. sub. Hen. 5.</i></div>

<p>Such great hope, and good expectation was had of this mans fortunate successe
to follow, that within thr&eacute;e daies after his fathers deceasse, diuerse noble
men and honorable personages did to him homage, and sware to him due obedience,
which had not b&eacute;ene s&eacute;ene doone to any of his predecessors kings of this realme,
till they had b&eacute;ene possessed of the crowne. He was crowned the ninth of Aprill
being Passion sundaie, which was a sore, ruggie, and tempestuous day, with wind,
snow and sl&eacute;et, that men greatlie maruelled thereat, making diuerse interpretations
what the same might signifie. But this king euen at first appointing with himselfe,
to shew that in his person princelie honors should change publike manners, he
determined to put on him the shape of a new man. For whereas aforetime he had
made himselfe a companion vnto misrulie mates of dissolute order and life, he now
banished them all from his presence (but not vnrewarded, or else vnpreferred) inhibiting
them vpon a great paine, not once to approch, lodge, or soiourne within
ten miles of his court or presence: and in their places he chose men of grauitie,
wit, and high policie, by whose wise councell he might at all times rule to his
honour and dignitie; calling to mind how once to hie offence of the king his father,
he had with his fist striken the ch&eacute;efe iustice for sending one of his minions (vpon
desert) to prison, when the iustice stoutlie commanded himselfe also streict to ward,
&amp; he (then prince) obeied. The king after expelled him out of his priuie councell,
banisht him the court, and made the duke of Clarence (his yoonger brother) president
of councell in his st&eacute;ed. This reformation in the new king Christ. Okl. hath reported,
fullie consenting with this. For saith he,</p>

<div class="sidenote">A parlement.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Thos Walsin.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The funerals of King Henrie the fourth kept at Canturburie</div>

<p>But now that the king was once placed in the roiall seat of the realme, he vertuouslie
considering in his mind, that all goodnesse commeth of God, determined
to begin with some thing acceptable to his diuine maiestie, and therefore commanded
the cleargie sincerelie and trulie to preach the word of God, and to liue accordinglie,
that they might be the lanternes of light to the temporaltie, as their profession
required. The laie men he willed to serue God, and obeie their prince, prohibiting
them aboue all things breach of matrimonie, custome in swearing; and namelie,
willfull periurie. Beside this, he elected the best learned men in the lawes of the
realme, to the offices of iustice; and men of good liuing, he preferred to high degr&eacute;es
and authoritie. Immediatlie after Easter he called a parlement, in which diuerse
good statutes, and wholesome ordinances, for the preseruation and aduancement of
the common-wealth were deuised and established. On Trinitie sundaie were the
solemne exequies doone at Canturburie for his father, the king himselfe being
present thereat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">S. Georges day made a double feast.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Abr. Fl.</i> out of <i>Polychron.</i></div>

<p>About the same time, at the speciall instance of the king, in a conuocation of
the cleargie holden at Paules in London, it was ordeined, that saint George his
daie should be celebrate and kept as a double feast. The archbishop of Canturburie
meant to haue honored saint Dunstaines daie with like reuerence, but it tooke not
effect. When the king had setled things much to his purpose, he caused the bodie
of king Richard to be remooued with all funerall dignitie conuenient for his estate,
from Langlie to Westminster, where he was honorablie interred with qu&eacute;ene Anne
his first wife, in a solemne toome erected and set vp at the charges of this king.
&para; Polychronicon saith, that after the bodie of the dead king was taken vp out of
earth, this new king (happilie tendering the magnifience of a prince, and abhorring
obscure buriall) caused the same to be conueied to Westminster in a roiall seat
(or chaire of estate) couered all ouer with blacke veluet, &amp; adorned with banners
of diuers armes round about. All the horsses likewise (said this author) were apparelled
with blacke, and bare sundrie sutes of armes. Manie other solemnities were had
at his interrement, according to the qualitie of the age wherein he liued and died.</p>

<p>Also in this first y&eacute;ere of this kings reigne, sir Iohn Oldcastell, which by his
wife was called lord Cobham, a valiant capteine and a hardie gentleman, was accused
to the archbishop of Canturburie of certeine points of heresie, who knowing him
to be highlie in the kings fauour, declared to his highnesse the whole accusation.
The king first hauing compassion of the noble man, required the prelats, that if
he were a straied sh&eacute;epe, rather by gentlenes than by rigor to reduce him to the
fold. And after this, he himselfe sent for him, and right earnestlie exhorted him,
and louinglie admonished him to reconcile himselfe to God and to his lawes. The
lord Cobham not onelie thanked him for his most fauorable clemencie, but also
declared first to him by mouth, and afterwards by writing, the foundation of his
faith, and the ground of his beliefe, affirming his grace to be his supreme head and
competent iudge, and none other person, offering an hundred knights and esquiers
to come to his purgation, or else to fight in open lists in defence of his iust cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Sir Iohn Oldcastell escaped out of the Tower.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Titus Liuius.</i> 1414</div>

<p>The king vnderstanding and persuaded by his councell, that by order of the lawes
of his realme, such accusations touching matters of faith ought to be tried by his
spirituall prelats, sent him to the Tower of London, there to abide the determination
of the clergie, according to the statutes in that case prouided, after which time a
solemne session was appointed in the cathedrall church of saint Paule, vpon the thr&eacute;e
and twentith day of September, and an other the fiue and twentith daie of the same
moneth, in the hall of the Blacke friers at London, in which places the said lord was
examined, apposed, and fullie heard, and in conclusion by the archbishop of Canturburie
denounced an heretike, &amp; remitted againe to the Tower of London, from which
place, either by helpe of fr&eacute;ends, or fauour of k&eacute;epers, he priuilie escaped and came into
Wales, where he remained for a season.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Hall.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">A commotion raised by sir Roger Acton and others.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Titus Liuius.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The rebels surprised.</div>

<p>After this, the king k&eacute;eping his Christmasse at his manor of Eltham, was aduertised,
that sir Roger Acton knight a man of great wit and possessions, Iohn Browne esquier,
Iohn Beuerlie priest, and a great number of other were assembled in armour against
the king, his brethren, the clergie and realme. These newes came to the king, on the
twelfth dale in Christmasse, wherevpon vnderstanding that they were in a place called
Ficket field beside London, on the backe side of saint Giles, he streight got him to
his palace at Westminster, in as secret wise as he might, and there calling to him certeine
bands of armed men, he repaired into saint Giles fields, n&eacute;ere to the said place (where
he vnderstood they should fulle m&eacute;et about midnight) and so handled the matter, that
he tooke some, and slue some, euen as stood with his pleasure. The capteins of them
afore mentioned, being apprehended, were brought to the kings presence, and to him
declared the causes of their commotion &amp; rising, accusing a great number of their
complices.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thom. Walsin.</div>

<div class="sidenote">By this excessive number it may appeare, that Walsingham reporteth this matter according to the co&#x0304;mon fame, and not as that searched out an exquisite truth.</div>

<p>The king vsed one policie, which much serued to the discomfiting of the aduersaries
(as Thom. Walsingham saith) which was this: he gaue order, that all the gates of
London should be streictlie kept and garded, so as none should come in or out, but
such as were knowen to go to the king. Hereby came it to passe, that the chiefest
succour appointed to come to the capteins of the rebels, was by that meanes cut off,
where otherwise suerlie (had it not b&eacute;ene thus preuented and staied) there had issued
foorth of London to haue ioined with them, to the number (as it was thought) of fiftie
thousand persons, one and other, seruants, prentises, and citizens, confederate with
them that were thus assembled in Ficket field. Diuerse also that came from sundrie
parts of the realme, hasting towards the place, to be there at their appointed time,
chanced to light among the kings men, who being taken and demanded whither they
went with such sp&eacute;ed, answered, they came to m&eacute;et with their capteine the lord
Cobham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">William Murlie.</div>

<p>But whether he came thither at all, or made shift for himselfe to get awaie, it dooth
not appeare; for he could not be heard of that time (as Thomas Walsingham confesseth)
although the king by proclamation promised a thousand marks to him that could
bring him foorth, with great liberties to the cities or townes that would discouer where
he was. By this it maie appeare, how greatlie he was beloued, that there could not
one be found, that for so great a reward would bring him to light. Among other that
were taken was one William Murlie, who dwelt in Dunstable, a man of great wealth,
and by his occupation a brewer, an earnest mainteiner of the lord Cobhams opinions,
and (as the brute ran) in hope to be highlie aduanced by him if their purposed deuise
had taken place, apparant by this; that he had two horsses trapped with guilt harnesse
led after him, and in his bosome a paire of gilt spurs (as it was d&eacute;emed) prepared for
himselfe to weare, looking to be made knight by the lord Cobhams hands at that present
time. But when he saw how their purpose quailed, he withdrew into the citie
with great feare to hide himselfe; howbeit he was perceiued, taken, and finallie executed
among others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Roger Acton &amp; his complices condemned of treason and heresie.</div>

<p>To conclude, so manie persons herevpon were apprehended, that all the prisons in
and about London were full, the chiefe of them were condemned by the cleargie of
heresie, and atteinted of high treason in the Guildhall of London, and adiudged for
that offense to be drawen and hanged, and for heresie to be consumed with fire, gallowes
and all, which iudgement was executed the same moneth, on the said sir Roger
Acton, and eight and twentie others. &para; Some saie, that the occasion of their death
was onelie for the conueieng of the lord Cobham out of prison. Others write, that it
was both for treason and heresie, and so it appeareth by the record. Certeine affirme,
that it was for feined causes surmized by the spiritualtie, more vpon displeasure than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
truth, and that they were assembled to heare their preacher (the foresaid Beuerlie) in
that place there, out of the waie from resort of people, sith they might not come togither
openlie about any such matter, without danger to be apprehended; as the manner
is, and hath b&eacute;ene euer of the persecuted flocke, when they are prohibited publikelie
the exercise of their religion. But howsoeuer the matter went with these men, apprehended
they were, and diuerse of them executed (as before ye haue heard) whether for
rebellion or heresie, or for both (as the forme of the indictment importeth) I n&eacute;ed not
to spend manie words, sith others haue so largelie treated thereof; and therefore I
refer those that wish to be more fullie satisfied herein vnto their reports.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Persie restored to the erledome of Northumberland.</div>

<p>Whilest in the Lent season the king laie at Killingworth, there came to him from
Charles Dolphin of France certeine ambassadors, that brought with them a barrell of
Paris balles, which from their maister they presented to him for a token that was
taken in verie ill part, as sent in scorne, to signifie, that it was more m&eacute;et for the king
to passe the time with such childish exercise, than to attempt any worthie exploit.
Wherefore the K. wrote to him, that yer ought long, he would tosse him some London
balles that perchance should shake the walles of the best court in France. &para; This
yeare, Thom. Arundell archbishop of Canturburie departed this life, a stout prelat,
and an earnest mainteiner of the Romish religion: Henrie Chichelie bishop of saint
Dauid succ&eacute;eded the same Arundell in the s&eacute;e of Canturburie, and the kings confessor
Stephan Patrington a Carmelite frier was made bishop of S. Dauid. Henrie Persie
then but a child, sonne to the lord Henrie Persie surnamed Hotspur, after his fathers
deceasse, that was slaine at Shrewesburie field, was conueied into Scotland, and there
left by his grandfather, where euer since he had remained: the king therefore pitied
his case, and so procured for him, that he came home, and was restored to all his
lands and earledome of Northumberland, which lands before had b&eacute;ene giuen to
Iohn, the kings brother.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>W. P.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Le Rosier la second partie.</i></div>

<p>A case verie strange, and for manie causes alwaies right worthie of remembrance,
in this yeare 1414, the second of this kings reigne did befall, which conteining in it
so manie matters for knowledge of Gods great power and iustice of wilfull breaking
his diuine lawes, of the easie slip into ruine where his mercie dooth not staie vs, the
busie bogging of the diuell alwaies, our weakenesse in combat with him, into what
outrage and confusion he haleth where he is not withstood, with what tyrannie he
tormenteth where he vanquisheth, what the will and power of a souereigne ouer a
subiect may force in cases of iniquitie, where by vertue and grace he be not restrained:
the zeale of a parent, the pangs of a child, but ch&eacute;eflie the verie plague of Gods
wrath and indignation vpon wilfull and obstinate offendors, all which at those daies
though touched in Naples, yet at all times and euerie where so well seruing for example
and warning, it hath b&eacute;ene thought verie conuenient the same in our stories also
h&eacute;ere to be noted, which was thus. At this time newes were brought into France,
how king Lancelot (the aduersarie to Lewes king of Sicill) was departed, and in manner
thus. It hapned that he fell in loue with a yoong damosell his owne physicians
daughter (a puzell verie beautifull) and he in hope to inioy hir the easilier, caused hir
father for his consent to be talked withall in the matter, which he vtterlie refused to
grant, and shewed foorth manie reasons for him; but at last all causes &amp; excuses
reiected, sith (though constreinetl) he must n&eacute;eds assent, feined himselfe willing and
content. And forceing talke with his daughter vpon his mind in the matter, ch&eacute;eflie
how m&eacute;et it were she vsed his counsell how best with the king to k&eacute;epe hir still in
grace, he gaue hir a little box of ointment, and instruction withall, that when the
king should come to haue his will, she should afore with that balme annoint all hir
wombe; the damosell o&#x0304;n good obseruation did after (at oportunitie) as hir father taught
hir. H&eacute;erevpon so pittifullie came it to passe that the verie same night the king laie
with hir, his bellie and hirs were by and by set as it were all on a sindging fier, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
torments of such vnquenchable scorching and burning euen into the verie entrailes,
that he of his kingdome, his life, his loue; and she of hir princelie promotion, thus
soone both togither made a sorrowfull end. After the plaie of this lamentable tragedie,
the physician fled for his safetie, and straight vpon the newes king Lewes
gathered a great assemblie, wherewith to passe towards Naples, and sent before a
good companie vnder the lord Longnie marshall of France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An. Reg. 2. 1414</div>

<div class="sidenote">A bill exhibited to the parleme&#x0304;t against the clergie.</div>

<p>In the second yeare of his reigne, king Henrie called his high court of parlement,
the last daie of Aprill in the towne of Leicester, in which parlement manie profitable
lawes were concluded, and manie petitions mooued, were for that time deferred.
Amongst which, one was, that a bill exhibited in the parlement holden at Westminster
in the eleuenth yeare of king Henrie the fourth (which by reason the king was then
troubled with ciuill discord, came to none effect) might now with good deliberation
be pondered, and brought to some good conclusion. The effect of which supplication
was, that the temporall lands deuoutlie giuen, and disordinatlie spent by religious,
and other spirituall persons, should be seized into the kings hands, sith the
same might suffice to mainteine, to the honor of the king, and defense of the realme,
fift&eacute;ene earles, fift&eacute;ene hundred knights, six thousand and two hundred esquiers,
and a hundred almesse-houses, for reliefe onelie of the poore, impotent, and n&eacute;edie
persons, and the king to haue cl&eacute;erelie to his coffers twentie thousand pounds, with
manie other prouisions and values of religious houses, which I passe ouer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The archbishop of Canturburies oration in the parlement house.</div>

<p>This bill was much noted, and more feared among the religious sort, whom suerlie
it touched verie n&eacute;ere, and therefore to find remedie against it, they determined to
assaie all waies to put by and ouerthrow this bill: wherein they thought best to trie
if they might mooue the kings mood with some sharpe inuention, that he should not
regard the importunate petitions of the commons. Wherevpon, on a daie in the parlement,
Henrie Chichelie archbishop of Canturburie made a pithie oration, wherein he
declared, how not onelie the duchies of Normandie and Aquitaine, with the counties
of Aniou and Maine, and the countrie of Gascoigne, were by vndoubted title
apperteining to the king, as to the lawfull and onelie heire of the same; but also
the whole realme of France, as heire to his great grandfather king Edward the third.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Salike law.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Mesina.</div>

<p>Herein did he much inueie against the surmised and false fained law Salike, which
the Frenchmen alledge euer against the kings of England in barre of their iust title to
the crowne of France. The verie words of that suppose'd law are these, In terram
Salicam mulieres ne succedant, that is to saie, Into the Salike land let not women
succ&eacute;ed. Which the French glossers expound to be the realme of France, and that
this law was made by king Pharamond; whereas yet their owne authors affirme,
that the land Salike is in Germanie, betw&eacute;ene the riuers of Elbe and Sala; and that
when Charles the great had ouercome the Saxons, he placed there certeine Frenchmen,
which hauing in disdeine the dishonest maners of the Germane women, made a
law, that the females should not succ&eacute;ed to any inheritance within that land, which
at this daie is called Meisen, so that if this be true, this law was not made for the realme
of France, nor the Frenchmen possessed the land Salike, till foure hundred and one and
twentie yeares after the death of Pharamond, the supposed maker of this Salike law,
for this Pharamond deceassed in the yeare 426, and Charles the great subdued the
Saxons, and placed the Frenchmen in those parts beyond the riuer of Sala in the
yeare 805.</p>

<p>Moreouer, it appeareth by their owne writers, that king Pepine, which deposed
Childerike, claimed the crowne of France, as heire generall, for that he was descended
of Blithild daughter to king Clothair the first: Hugh Capet also, who vsurped
the crowne vpon Charles duke of Loraine, the sole heire male of the line and stocke of
Charles the great, to make his title s&eacute;eme true, and appeare good, though in d&eacute;ed it
was starke naught, conueied himselfe as heire to the ladie Lingard, daughter to king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Charlemaine, sonne to Lewes the emperour, that was son to Charles the great. King
Lewes also the tenth otherwise called saint Lewes, being verie heire to the said vsurper
Hugh Capet, could neuer be satisfied in his conscience how he might iustlie k&eacute;epe
and possease the crowne of France, till he was persuaded and fullie instructed, that
qu&eacute;ene Isabell his grandmother was lineallie descended of the ladie Ermengard daughter
and heire to the aboue named Charles duke of Loraine, by the which marriage,
the bloud and line of Charles the great was againe vnited and restored to the crowne
&amp; scepter of France, so that more cl&eacute;ere than the sunne it openlie appeareth, that the
title of king Pepin, the claime of Hugh Capet, the possession of Lewes, yea and the
French kings to this daie, are deriued and conueied from the heire female, though they
would vnder the colour of such a fained law, barre the kings and princes of this realme
of England of their right and lawfull inheritance.</p>

<p>The archbishop further alledged out of the booke of Numbers this saieng: "When a
man dieth without a sonne, let the inheritance descend to his daughter." At length,
hauing said sufficientlie for the proofe of the kings iust and lawfull title to the
crowne of France, he exhorted him to aduance foorth his banner to fight for his right,
to conquer his inheritance, to spare neither bloud, sword, nor fire, sith his warre was
iust, his cause good, and his claime true. And to the intent his louing chapleins and
obedient subiects of the spiritualtie might shew themselues willing and desirous to
aid his maiestie, for the recouerie of his ancient right and true inheritance, the archbishop
declared that in their spirituall conuocation, they had granted to his highnesse
such a summe of monie, as neuer by no spirituall persons was to any prince before those
daies giuen or aduanced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Westmerland persuadeth the king to the conquest of Scotland.</div>

<p>When the archbishop had ended his prepared tale, Rafe Neuill earle of Westmerland,
and as then lord Warden of the marches against Scotland, vnderstanding that
the king vpon a couragious desire to recouer his right in France, would suerlie take
the wars in hand, thought good to mooue the king to begin first with Scotland, and
therevpon declared how easie a matter it should be to make a conquest there, and how
greatlie the same should further his wished purpose for the subduing of the Frenchmen,
concluding the summe of his tale with this old saieng: that Who so will France
win, must with Scotland first begin. Manie matters he touched, as well to shew
how necessarie the conquest of Scotland should be, as also to prooue how iust a cause
the king had to attempt it, trusting to persuade the king and all other to be of his
opinion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Excester his wise and pithie answer to the earle of Westmerla&#x0304;ds saieng.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A true saieng.</div>

<p>But after he had made an end, the duke of Excester, vncle to the king, a man well
learned and wise, (who had b&eacute;ene sent into Italie by his father intending that he
should haue b&eacute;en a pr&eacute;est) replied against the erle of Westmerlands oration, affirming
rather that he which would Scotland win, he with France must first begin. For
if the king might once compasse the conquest of France, Scotland could not long
resist; so that conquere France, and Scotland would soone obeie. For where should
the Scots lerne policie and skill to defend themselues, if they had not their bringing
vp and training in France? If the French pensions mainteined not the Scotish nobilitie,
in what case should they be? Then take awaie France, and the Scots will soone
be tamed; France being to Scotland the same that the sap is to the tr&eacute;e, which being
taken awaie, the tr&eacute;e must n&eacute;eds die and wither.</p>

<p>To be briefe, the duke of Excester vsed such earnest and pithie persuasions, to induce
the king and the whole assemblie of the parlement to credit his words, that immediatlie
after he had made an end, all the companie began to crie; Warre, warre; France,
France. Hereby the bill for dissoluing of religious houses was cl&eacute;erelie set aside, and
nothing thought on but onelie the recouering of France, according as the archbishop
had mooued. And vpon this point, after a few acts besides for the wealth of the realme
established, the parlement was proroged vnto Westminster. &para; Some write, that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
this parlement it was enacted, that Lollards and heretikes with their mainteiners
and fauourers should be Ipso facto adiudged guiltie of high treason: but in the statute
made in the same parlement against Lollards, we find no such words: albeit by force
of that statute it was ordeined, that persons so conuicted &amp; executed, should lose
their lands holden in f&eacute;e simple, and all other their goods and cattels, as in cases
of felonie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ambassadors from the Fre&#x0304;ch king and from the duke of Burgognie.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Creation of dukes.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Harding.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">Ambassadors sent to Fra&#x0304;ce.</div>

<p>During this parlement, there came to the king ambassadors, as well from the French
king that was then in the hands of the Orlientiall faction, as also from the duke of
Burgognie, for aid against that faction; promising more (as was said) than laie well in
his power to performe. The king shortlie after sent ambassadors to them both, as the
bishop of Durham, and Norwich, with others. Moreouer at this parlement, Iohn the
kings brother was created duke of Bedford, and his brother Humfrie duke of Glocester.
Also, Thomas Beaufort, marquesse Dorset, was created duke of Excester. Immediatlie
after, the king sent ouer into France his vncle the duke of Excester, the
lord Greie admerall of England, the archbishop of Dubline, and the bishop of Norwich,
ambassadors vnto the French king, with fiue hundred horsse, which were lodged
in the temple house in Paris, k&eacute;eping such triumphant ch&eacute;ere in their lodging, and
such a solemne estate in their riding through the citie, that the Parisiens and all the
Frenchmen had no small meruell at their honorable port.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Abr. Fl.</i> out of <i>In Angl. pr&aelig;l. sub Hen. 5.</i></div>

<p>The French king receiued them verie honorablie, and banketted them right sumptuouslie,
shewing to them iusts and Martiall pastimes, by the space of thr&eacute;e daies togither,
in the which iusts the king himselfe, to shew his courage and actiuitie to the
Englishmen, manfullie brake speares and lustilie tournied. When the triumph
was ended, the English ambassadors, hauing a time appointed them to declare their
message, admitted to the French kings presence, required of him to deliuer vnto the
king of England the realme and crowne of France, with the entier duchies of Aquiteine,
Normandie and Aniou, with the countries of Poictiou and Maine. Manie other
requests they made: and this offered withall, that if the French king would without
warre and effusion of christian bloud, render to the king their maister his verie right
&amp; lawfull inheritance, that he would be content to take in mariage the ladie Katharine,
daughter to the French king, and to indow hir with all the duchies and countries
before rehearsed; and if he would not so doo, then the king of England did expresse
and signifie to him, that with the aid of God, and helpe of his people, he would
recouer his right and inheritance wrongfullie withholden from him, with mortall
warre, and dint of sword. &para; This in effect dooth our English poet comprise in his
report of the occasion, which Henrie the fift tooke to arrere battell against the French
king: putting into the mouthes of the said king of Englands ambassadors an imagined
sp&eacute;ech, the conclusion whereof he maketh to be either restitution of that which
the French had taken and deteined from the English, or else fire and sword. His
words are these,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">---- raptum nobis aut redde Britannis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aut ferrum expectes, vltrices insuper ignes.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Frenchmen being not a little abashed at these demands, thought not to make
anie absolute answer in so weightie a cause, till they had further breathed; and therefore
praied the English ambassadors to saie to the king their maister, that they now
hauing no opportunitie to conclude in so high a matter, would shortlie send ambassadors
into England, which should certifie &amp; declare to the king their whole mind,
purpose, and intent. The English ambassadors returned with this answer, making
relation of euerie thing that was said or doone. King Henrie after the returne of his
ambassadors, determined fullie to make warre in France, conceiuing a good and perfect
hope to haue fortunate successe, sith victorie for the most part followeth where
right leadeth, being aduanced forward by iustice, and set foorth by equitie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It is not like that in this councell writers meane the parlement that was adiorned from Leicester to Westminster, where it began in the octaues of saint Martin, in this second yeare 1415.</div>

<p>And bicause manie Frenchmen were promoted to ecclesiasticall dignities, as some
to benefices, and some to abbeies and priories within the realme, and sent dailie innumerable
summes of monie into France for the rel&eacute;efe of their naturall countrimen and
kinsfolke, he therefore in fauour of the publike wealth of his realme and subjects, in
a councell called at London, about Michaelmas, caused to be ordeined, that no stranger
hereafter should be promoted to anie spirituall dignitie or degr&eacute;e within this realme,
without his especiall licence, and roiall consent; and all they that should be admitted,
should find sufficient suerties, not to disclose the secrets of this realme to anie forren
person, nor to minister aid or succour to anie of them with monie, or by anie other
meanes. This was confirmed in a conuocation called at the same time by the new
archbishop of Canturburie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The councell of Constance.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Warwike and others sent to the generall councell.</div>

<p>Moreouer, such as were to go vnto the generall councell holden at Constance, were
named and appointed to make them readie: for the king hauing knowledge from
the emperor Sigismund, of the assembling of that councell, thought it not conuenient
to sit still as an hearer, and no partaker in so high a cause, which touched the whole
state of the christian common-wealth, as then troubled by reason of the schisme that
yet continued. Wherefore he sent thither Richard earle of Warwike, the bishops of
Salisburie, Bath, and Hereford, the abbat of Westminster, and the prior of Worcester,
with diuerse other doctors and learned men of the spiritualtie; besides knights and
esquiers. They were in number eight hundred horsses, so well appointed and furnished,
as well the men as horsses, that all nations maruelled to s&eacute;e such an honorable companie
come from a countrie so far distant.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Enguerant.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">Great preparation for the French wars.</div>

<p>Diuerse other things were concluded at that present: for the king had caused not
onelie the lords of the spiritualtie, but also of the temporaltie to assemble here at London
the same time, to treat speciallie of his iournie that he purposed to make shortlie into
France: and herevpon meanes was made for the gathering of monie; which was
granted with so good a will both of the spiritualtie and temporaltie, that there was
leuied the summe of thr&eacute;e hundred thousand markes English: and herewith order
was giuen to gather a great hoast of men, thorough all his dominions. And for the
more increasing of his nauie, he sent into Holland, Zeland, and Frizeland, to conduct
and hire ships for the transporting and conueieng ouer of his men and munitions of
war, and finallie prouided for armour, victuals, monie, artillerie, cariage, boates to
passe ouer riuers couered with leather, tents, and all other things requisite for so high
an enterprise.</p>

<p>The Frenchmen hauing knowledge hereof, the Dolphin, who had the gouernance
of the realme, bicause his father was fallen into his old disease of frensie, sent for the
dukes of Berrie and Alanson, and all the other lords of the councell of France: by
whose aduise it was determined, that they should not onelie prepare a sufficient armie
to resist the king of England, when so euer he arriued to inuade France, but also to
stuffe and furnish the townes on the frontiers and sea coasts with conuenient garrisons
of men: and further to send to the king of England a solemne ambassage, to make to
him some offers according to the demands before rehearsed. The charge of this ambassage
was committed to the earle of Vandosme, to maister William Bouratier archbishop
of Burges, and to maister Peter Fremell bishop of Liseur, to the lords of Yvry and
Braquemont, and to maister Gaultier Cole the kings secretarie, and diuerse others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An. Reg. 3.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Ambassadors out of France.</div>

<p>These ambassadors accompanied with 350 horsses, passed the sea at Calis, and
landed at Douer, before whose arriuall the king was departed from Windsore to
Winchester, intending to haue gone to Hampton, there to haue surueied his nauie;
but hearing of the ambassadors approching, he tarried still at Winchester, where the
said French lords shewed themselues verie honorablie before the king and his nobilitie.
At time prefixed, before the kings presence, sitting in his throne imperiall, the archbishop
of Burges made an eloquent and a long oration, dissuading warre, and praising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
peace; offering to the king of England a great summe of monie, with diuerse countries,
being in verie d&eacute;ed but base and poore, as a dowrie with the ladie Catharine in
mariage, so that he would dissolue his armie, and dismisse his soldiers, which he had
gathered and put in a readinesse.</p>

<p>When his oration was ended, the king caused the ambassadors to be highlie feasted,
and set them at his owne table. And after a daie assigned in the foresaid hall, the archbishop
of Canturburie to their oration made a notable answer, the effect whereof was,
that if the French king would not giue with his daughter in mariage the duches of
Aquiteine, Aniou, and all other seigniories and dominions sometimes apperteining to
the noble progenitors of the king of England, he would in no wise retire his armie,
nor breake his iournie; but would with all diligence enter into France, and destroie
the people, waste the countrie, and subuert the townes with blood, sword, and fire, and
neuer ceasse till he had recouered his ancient right and lawfull patrimonie. The king
auowed the archbishops saieng, and in the word of a prince promised to performe it
to the vttermost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A proud presumptuous prelat.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The wise answer of the k. to the bishop.</div>

<p>The archbishop of Burges much gr&eacute;eued, that his ambassage was no more regarded,
after certeine brags blustered out with impatience, as more presuming vpon his prelasie,
than respecting his dutie of considerance to whom he spake and what became
him to saie, he praied safe conduct to depart. Which the king gentlie granted, and
added withall to this effect: "I little est&eacute;eme your French brags, &amp; lesse set by your
power and strength; I know perfectlie my right to my region, which you vsurpe; &amp;
except you denie the apparant truth, so doo your selues also; if you neither doo nor
will know it, yet God and the world knoweth it. The power of your master you s&eacute;e,
but my puissance ye haue not yet tasted. If he haue louing subiects, I am (I thanke
God) not vnstored of the same: and I saie this vnto you, that before one yeare passe,
I trust to make the highest crowne of your countrie to stoope, and the proudest miter
to learne his humiliatedo. In the meane time tell this to the vsurper your master,
that within thr&eacute;e moneths, I will enter into France, as into mine owne true and lawfull
patrimonie, appointing to acquire the same, not with brag of words, but with d&eacute;eds of men,
and dint of sword, by the aid of God, in whome is my whole trust and confidence.
Further matter at this present I impart not vnto you, sauing that with warrant you
maie depart suerlie and safelie into your countrie, where I trust sooner to visit you,
than you shall haue cause to bid me welcome." With this answer the ambassadors
sore displeased in their minds (although they were highlie interteined and liberallie
rewarded) departed into their countrie, reporting to the Dolphin how they had
sped.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Harding.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">An ouerthrow to the Scots by sir Robert Umfreuill.</div>

<p>After the French ambassadors were departed, the king like a prouident prince,
thought good to take order for the resisting of the Scots, if (according to their maner)
they should attempt anie thing against his subiects in his absence. For that point appointed
he the earle of Westmerland, the lord Scroope, the baron of Greistocke, sir
Robert Umfreuill, &amp; diuerse other valiant capteins to k&eacute;epe the frontiers &amp; marches of
Scotland, which sir Robert Umfreuill on the daie of Marie Madgdalen fought with the
Scots at the towne of Gedering, hauing in his companie onelie thr&eacute;e hundred archers,
and seuen score spears, where he (after long conflict) slue of his enimies sixtie and odde,
tooke thr&eacute;e hundred and sixtie prisoners, discomfited and put to flight one thousand and
more, whome he followed in chace aboue twelue miles, but their hands full of preies

which he was capteine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The qu&eacute;ene mother gouernour of the realme.</div>

<p>When the king had all prouisions readie, and ordered all things for the defense of his

law, departed to Southampton, to take ship into France. And first princelie appointing
to aduertise the French king of his comming, therefore dispatched Antelope his purseu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>ant
at armes with letters to him for restitution of that which he wrongfully withheld,
contrarie to the lawes of God and man: the king further declaring how sorie he
was that he should be thus compelled for repeating of his right and iust title of inheritance,
to make warre to the distruction of christian people, but sithens he had offered
peace which could not be receiued, now for fault of iustice, he was forced to take armes.
Neuerthelesse exhorted the French king in the bowels of Iesu Christ, to render him
that which was his owne, whereby effusion of Christian bloud might be auoided.
These letters ch&eacute;eflie to this effect and purpose, were written and dated from Hampton the
fift of August. When the same were presented to the French King, and by his councell
well perused, answer was made, that he would take aduise, and prouide therein as
time and place should be conuenient, so the messenger licenced to depart at his

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Cambridge &amp; other lords apprehended for treason.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Thom. Wals.</i></div>

<p>When king Henrie had fullie furnished his nauie with men, munition, &amp; other prouisions,
perceiuing that his capteines misliked nothing so much as delaie, determined
his souldiors to go a ship-boord and awaie. But s&eacute;e the hap, the night before the daie
appointed for their departure, he was crediblie informed, that Richard earle of Cambridge
brother to Edward duke of Yorke, and Henrie lord Scroope of Masham lord
treasuror, with Thomas Graie a knight of Northumberland, being confederat togither,
had conspired his death: wherefore he caused them to be apprehended. The said lord
Scroope was in such fauour with the king, that he admitted him sometime to be his
bedfellow, in whose fidelitie the king reposed such trust, that when anie priuat or publike
councell was in hand, this lord had much in the determination of it. For he
represented so great grauitie in his countenance, such modestie in behauiour, and so
vertuous zeale to all godlinesse in his talke, that whatsoeuer he said was thought for
the most part necessarie to be doone and followed. Also the said sir Thomas Graie
(as some write) was of the kings priuie councell.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Hall.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">King Henries words to the traitours.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Cambridge and the other traitors executed.</div>

<p>These prisoners vpon their examination, confessed, that for a great summe of
monie which they had receiued of the French king, they intended verelie either to
haue deliuered the king aliue into the hands of his enimies, or else to haue murthered
him before he should arriue in the duchie of Normandie. When king Henrie
had heard all things opened, which he desired to know, he caused all his nobilitie
to come before his presence, before whome he caused to be brought the offendors
also, and to them said. "Hauing thus conspired the death and destruction of me,
which am the head of the realme and gouernour of the people, it maie be (no doubt)
but that you likewise haue sworne the confusion of all that are here with me, and also
the desolation of your owne countrie. To what horror (O lord) for any true English
hart to consider, that such an execrable iniquitie should euer so bewray you, as for
pleasing of a forren enimie to imbrue your hands in your bloud, and to ruine your
owne natiue soile. Reuenge herein touching my person, though I s&eacute;eke not; yet
for the safegard of you, my d&eacute;ere fr&eacute;ends, &amp; for due perseruation of all sorts, I am
by office to cause example to be shewed. Get ye hence therefore ye poore miserable
wretches to the receiuing of your iust reward, wherein Gods maiestie giue you
grace of his mercie and repentance of your heinous offenses." And so immediatlie they
were had to execution.</p>

<p>This doone, the king calling his lords againe afore him, said in words few and
with good grace. Of his enterprises he recounted the honor and glorie, whereof
they with him were to be partakers, the great confidence he had in their noble minds,
which could not but remember them of the famous feats that their ancestors aforetime
in France had atchiued, whereof the due report for euer recorded remained yet
in register. The great mercie of God that had so gratiouslie reuealed vnto him the
treason at hand, whereby the true harts of those afore him made so eminent &amp; apparant
in his eie, as they might be right sure he would neuer forget it. The doubt of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
danger to be nothing in respect of the certeintie of honor that they should acquire,
wherein himselfe (as they saw) in person would be lord and leader through Gods grace.
To whose maiestie as ch&eacute;eflie was knowne the equitie of his demand: euen so to his
mercie did he onelie recommend the successe of his trauels. When the king had said,
all the noble men kn&eacute;eled downe, &amp; promised faithfullie to serue him, dulie to obeie
him, and rather to die than to suffer him to fall into the hands of his enimies.</p>

<p>This doone, the king thought that suerlie all treason and conspiracie had b&eacute;ene
vtterlie extinct: not suspecting the fire which was newlie kindled, and ceassed not
to increase, till at length it burst out into such a flame, that catching the beames of
his house and familie, his line and stocke was cleane consumed to ashes. &para; Diuerse
write that Richard earle of Cambridge did not conspire with the lord Scroope &amp;
Thomas Graie for the murthering of king Henrie to please the French king withall, but
onelie to the intent to exalt to the crowne his brother in law Edmund earle of March
as heire to Lionell duke of Clarence: after the death of which earle of March, for
diuerse secret impediments, not able to haue issue, the earle of Cambridge was sure
that the crowne should come to him by his wife, and to his children, of hir begotten.
And therefore (as was thought) he rather confessed himselfe for n&eacute;ed of monie to be
corrupted by the French king, than he would declare his inward mind, and open his
verie intent and secret purpose, which if it were espied, he saw plainlie that the
earle of March should haue tasted of the same cuppe that he had drunken, and what
should haue come to his owne children he much doubted. Therefore destitute of
comfort &amp; in despaire of life to saue his children, he feined that tale, desiring rather
to saue his succession than himselfe, which he did in d&eacute;ed: for his sonne Richard
duke of Yorke not priuilie but openlie claimed the crowne, and Edward his sonne
both claimed it, &amp; gained it, as after it shall appeare. Which thing if king Henrie
had at this time either doubted, or fores&eacute;ene, had neuer b&eacute;ene like to haue come to
passe, as Hall saith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The effect of the earle of Cambridges indictement.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A iewell.</div>

<p>But whatsoeuer hath b&eacute;ene reported of the confession of the earle of Cambridge,
certeine it is that indicted he was by the name of Richard earle of Cambridge of Connesburgh
in the countie of Yorke knight, and with him Thomas Graie of Heton in the
countie of Northumberland knight; for that they the twentith daie of Iulie, in the
third yeare of king Henrie the fifts reigne, at Southampton, and in diuerse other places
within this realme, had conspired togither with a power of men to them associat, without
the kings licence, to haue led awaie the lord Edmund earle of March into Wales,
and then to haue procured him to take vpon him the supreme gouernment of the
realme, in case that king Richard the second were dead: and herwith had purposed
to set foorth a proclamation there in Wales, in name of the said earle of March, as
heire of the crowne against king Henrie, by the name of Henrie of Lancaster the
vsurper, to the end that by such meanes they might draw the more number of the
kings liege people vnto the said earle; and further to haue conueied a banner of the
armes of England, and a certeine crowne of Spaine set vpon a pallet, and laid in
gage to the said earle of Cambridge, by the king, togither with the said earle of
March into the parties of Wales aforesaid.</p>

<p>Further, that the said earle of Cambridge, and sir Thomas Graie had appointed
certeine of the kings liege people to repaire into Scotland, and to bring from thence
one Thomas Trumpington; also an other resembling in shape, fauour, and countenance
king Richard, and Henrie Persie, togither with a great multitude of people
to fight with the king, and him to destroie in open field. Beside this, that they had
meant to win certeine castels in Wales, and to k&eacute;epe them against the king: and
manie other treasons they had contriued, as by the indictement was specified, to the
intent they might destroie the king and his brethren, the dukes of Bedford and
Glocester, and other the great lords &amp; p&eacute;ers of the realme. And Henrie Scroope of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Masham, of Flarflet, in the countie of Yorke was likewise indicted, as consenting
to the premisses. So that it appeareth their purpose was well inough then perceiued,
although happilie not much bruted abroad, for considerations thought necessarie to
haue it rather husht and kept secret.</p>

<p>About the selfe same time the lord Cobham with his fr&eacute;ends, whether as one of
counsell in the conspiracie with the earle of Cambridge or not, was determined to
haue made some attempt against the lord of Aburgauennie, who being aduertised
thereof, got for his defense from Worcester, Persore, Teukesburie, and other places
thereabout, to the number of fiue thousand archers, and other armed men, which
came to him vnto his castell of Haneleie: whereof when the lord Cobham was aduertised,
he withdrew againe to such secret places about Maluerne, as he had prouided
for his suertie, to resort vnto: but a priest that belonged vnto him, was taken,
and diuerse other, who disclosed to the lord Aburgauennie, one of the places where
the said lord Cobham with his men vsed to k&eacute;epe themselues close. Vnto that place
the lord Aburgauennie went, where he found ind&eacute;ed monie and armor piled vp betwixt
two wals, handsomelie conueied and framed for the purpose; but the lord
Cobham with his folkes were withdrawne into some other place, after they once heard,
that the earle of Cambridge and the lord Scroope were executed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Princelie and wiselie.</div>

<p>But now to proc&eacute;ed with king Henries dooings. After this, when the wind came
about prosperous to his purpose, he caused the mariners to weie vp anchors, and
hoise vp sailes, and to set forward with a thousand ships, on the vigill of our ladie
daie the Assumption, and tooke land at Caur, commonlie called Kidcaur, where the
riuer of Saine runneth into the sea, without resistance. At his first comming on land,
he caused proclamation to be made, that no person should be so hardie on paine of
death, either to take anie thing out of anie church that belonged to the same, or to hurt
or doo anie violence either to priests, women, or anie such as should be found without
weapon or armor, and not readie to make resistance: also that no man should
renew anie quarell or strife, whereby anie fraie might arise to the disquieting of
the armie.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Harding.</i></div>

<p>The next daie after his landing, he marched toward the towne of Harflue, standing
on the riuer of Saine betw&eacute;ene two hils; he besieged it on euerie side, raising bulwarks
and a bastell, in which the two earles of Kent &amp; Huntington were placed, with
Cornwall, Graie, Steward, and Porter. On that side towards the sea, the king
lodged with his field, and the duke of Clarence on the further side towards Rone.
There were within the towne the lords de Touteuill and Gaucourt, with diuerse other
that valiantlie defended the siege, dooing what damage they could to their aduersaries;
and damming vp the riuer that hath his course through the towne, the water
rose so high betwixt the kings campe, and the duke of Clarence campe (diuided by
the same riuer) that the Englishmen were constreined to withdraw their artillerie from
one side, where they had planted the same.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king besieged Harflue.</div>

<p>The French king being aduertised, that king Henrie was arrived on that coast,
sent in all hast the lord de la Breth constable of France, the seneshall of France,
the lord Bouciqualt marshall of France, the seneshall of Henault, the lord Lignie
with other, which fortified townes with men, victuals, and artillerie on all those
frontiers towards the sea. And hearing that Harflue was besieged, they came to the
castell of Caudebecke, being not farre from Harflue, to the intent they might succor
their fr&eacute;ends which were besieged, by some policie or meanes: but the Englishmen,
notwithstanding all the damage that the Frenchmen could worke against them, forraied
the countrie, spoiled the villages, bringing manie a rich preie to the campe before
Harflue. And dailie was the towne assaulted: for the duke of Glocester, to
whome the order of the siege was committed, made thr&eacute;e mines vnder the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
and approching to the wals with his engins and ordinance, would not suffer them
within to take anie rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Titus Liuius.</i></div>

<p>For although they with their countermining somwhat disappointed the Englishmen,
&amp; came to fight with them hand to hand within the mines, so that they went
no further forward with that worke; yet they were so inclosed on ech side, as well
by water as land, that succour they saw could none come to them: for the king
lieng with his battell on the hill side on the one partie, and the duke of Clarence beyond
the riuer that passeth by the towne, and runneth into Saine on the other
partie, beside other lords and capteins that were lodged with their retinues for their
most aduantage: none could be suffered to go in, or come foorth, without their licence;
insomuch that such pouder as was sent to haue b&eacute;ene conueied into the
towne by water, was taken by the English ships that watched the riuer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The seuent&eacute;enth of September they within Harflue praie parl&eacute;e.</div>

<p>The capteins within the towne, perceiuing that they were not able long to resist
the continuall assaults of the Englishmen, knowing that their wals were vndermined,
and like to be ouerthrowne (as one of their bulwarks was alredie, where the earles
of Huntington and Kent had set vp their banners) sent an officer at armes foorth
about midnight after the feast daie of saint Lambert, which fell that yeare vpon the
tuesdaie, to bes&eacute;ech the king of England to appoint some certeine persons as commissioners
from him, with whome they within might treat about some agr&eacute;ement.
The duke of Clarence, to whome this messenger first declared his errand, aduertised
the king of their request, who granting thereto, appointed the duke of Excester,
with the lord Fitz Hugh, and sir Thomas Erpingham, to vnderstand their minds,
who at the first requested a truce vntill sundaie next following the feast of saint Michaell,
in which meane time if no succour came to remooue the siege, they would
vndertake to deliuer the towne into the kings hands, their liues and goods saued.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A fiue daies respit.</div>

<p>The king aduertised hereof, sent them word, that except they would surrender the
towne to him the morow next insuing, without anie condition, they should spend
no more time in talke about the matter. But yet at length through the earnest
sute of the French lords, the king was contented to grant them truce vntill nine
of the clocke the next sundaie, being the two and twentith of September; with
condition, that if in the meane time no rescue came, they should y&eacute;eld the towne
at that houre, with their bodies and goods to stand at the kings pleasure. And for
assurance thereof, they deliuered into the kings hands thirtie of their best capteins
and merchants within that towne as pledges. But other write, that it was couenanted,
that they should deliuer onelie twelue pledges, and that if the siege were
not raised by the French kings power within six daies next following, then should
they deliuer the towne into the king of England hands, and thirtie of the ch&eacute;efest
personages within the same, to stand for life or death at his will and pleasure: and
as for the residue of the men of warre and townesmen, they should depart whether
they would, without carieng foorth either armour, weapon, or goods.</p>

<p>The king neuerthelesse was after content to grant a respit vpon certeine conditions,
that the capteins within might haue time to send to the French king for succour
(as before ye haue heard) least he intending greater exploits, might lose time in such
small matters. When this composition was agr&eacute;ed vpon, the lord Bacqueuill was
sent vnto the French king, to declare in what point the towne stood. To whome
the Dolphin answered, that the kings power was not yet assembled, in such number
as was conuenient to raise so great a siege. This answer being brought vnto the
capteins within the towne, they rendered it vp to the king of England, after that the
third daie was expired, which was on the daie of saint Maurice being the seuen
and thirtith daie after the siege was first laid. The souldiors were ransomed, and
the towne sacked, to the great gaine of the Englishmen. &para;Some writing of this
y&eacute;elding vp of Harflue, doo in like sort make mention of the distresse whereto the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
people, then expelled out of their habitations, were driuen: insomuch as parents
with their children, yoong maids and old folke went out of the towne gates with
heauie harts (God wot) as put to their present shifts to s&eacute;eke them a new abode.
Besides that, king Henrie caused proclamation to be made within his owne dominions
of England, that whosoeuer (either handicraftesman, merchantman, gentleman,
or plowman) would inhabit in Harflue, should haue his dwelling giuen him gratis,
and his heire after him also inioy the like grace and fauour; insomuch that great
multitudes flocked to the sea coasts, waiting wind and wether for their transportage
into Harflue, where being arriued woonderfull it is to tell, within how short a
time the towne was peopled. This doth Anglorum pr&aelig;lia report, saieng (not without
good ground, I bel&eacute;eue) as followeth:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">---- tum flentes tenera cum prole parentes<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Oppidulo belli potiuntur iure Britanni, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All this doone, the king ordeined capteine to the towne his vncle the duke of
Excester, who established his lieutenant there, one sir Iohn Fastolfe, with fift&eacute;ene
hundred men, or (as some haue) two thousand and thirtie six knights, whereof the
baron of Carew, and sir Hugh Lutterell, were two councellors. And bicause manie
of his nobles whilest this siege laie before Harflue, fell sicke of the flix and other
diseases, diuerse also dead, amongst whom the earle of Stafford, the bishop of Norwich,
the lords Molins and Burnell were foure (beside others) the king licenced his
brother the duke of Clarence, Iohn earle marshall, and Iohn earle of Arundell, being
infected with that disease, to returne into England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Great death in the host by the flix.</div>

<p>King Henrie, after the winning of Harflue, determined to haue proc&eacute;eded further
in the winning of other townes and fortresses: but bicause the dead time of the
winter approched, it was determined by aduise of his councell, that he should in all
conuenient sp&eacute;ed set forward, and march through the countrie towards Calis by land,
least his returne as then homewards should of slanderous toongs be named a running
awaie: and yet that iournie was adjudged perillous, by reason that the number of
his people was much minished by the flix and other feuers, which sore vexed and
brought to death aboue fift&eacute;ene hundred persons of the armie: and this was the cause
that his returne was the sooner appointed and concluded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The kings mercifull dealing with the French prisoners.</div>

<p>But before his departing thence, he entered into the towne of Harflue, &amp; went to
the church of saint Martines, and there offered. All the men of warre which had
not paid their ransoms, he sware them on the holie euangelists, to y&eacute;eld themselues
prisoners at Calis by the feast of saint Martine in Nouember next. There were two
strong towers standing on the hauen side at Harflue, which looking for aid, did not
y&eacute;eld, till ten daies after the towne was rendered. When the king had repaired the
walles, bulwarks and rampiers about the towne, and furnished it with vittels and
artillerie, he remooued from Harflue toward Ponthoise, intending to passe the riuer
of Some with his armie, before the bridges were either withdrawen or broken. Such
vittels and other necessaries as were to be caried with the armie, he appointed to be
laid on horsses, leauing the carts and wagons behind for lesse incombre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Corne &amp; vittels destroied where the Englishmen should passe.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A skirmish with the garrison of Ew.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Enguerant.</i></div>

<p>The French king hearing that the towne of Harflue was gotten, and that the king
of England was marching forward into the bowels of the realme of France, sent out
proclamations, and assembled people on euerie side, committing the whole charge of
his armie to his sonne the Dolphine and duke of Aquitaine, who incontinentlie caused
the bridges to be broken, and the passages to be kept. Also they caused all the corne
and vittels to be conueied awaie, or destroied in all places, where it was coniectured
that the Englishmen would passe. The king of England nothing dismaied herewith,
kept his iournie in spite of his enimies, constreining them within diuerse townes and
holds to furnish him with vittels: but yet as he passed by the towne of Ew, the garrison
of the towne issued foorth, and gaue the Englishmen a skirmish, who beat them
into the towne with losse, namelie of a right valiant man of armes, named Lancelot
Piers. There were manie Englishmen hurt with quarels shot off from the loops and
wals, as they pursued the enimies vnto the gates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Blanchetake.</div>

<p>At length the king approched the riuer of Some, &amp; finding all the bridges broken,
he came to the passage of Blanchetake, where his great grandfather king Edward the
third a little before had striken the battell of Cressie: but the passage was now so impeached
with stakes in the botome of the foord, that he could not passe, his enimies
besides there awaie so swarming on all sides. He therefore marched forwards to
Arames, marching with his armie, and passing with his carriage in so martiall a
maner, that he appeared so terrible to his enimies, as they durst not offer him battell.
And yet the lord Dalbreth constable of France, the marshall Boncequault, the earle of
Vendosme great master of France, the duke of Alanson, and the earle of Richmont,
with all the puissance of the Dolphin laie at Abuile, but euer kept the passages, and
coasted aloofe, like a hauke though eager yet not hardie on hir preie. The king of
England kept on his iournie till he came to the bridge of saint Marence, where he
found aboue thirtie thousand Frenchmen, and there pitched his field, looking suerlie
to be fought withall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1585.</div>

<p>Wherefore to incourage his capteins the more, he dubbed certeine of his hardie
and valiant gentlemen knights, as Iohn lord Ferrers of Grobie, Reginald of Greistocke,
Piers Tempest, Christopher Morisbie, Thomas Pikering, William Huddleston,
Iohn Hosbalton, Henrie Mortimer, Philip Hall, and William his brother, Iaques de
Ormond, and diuerse other: but the French making no semblance to fight, he departed
in good order of battell by the towne of Amiens, to another towne n&eacute;ere to a
castell called Bowes, and there laie two daies looking for their bidding of battell
euerie houre. From thence he came n&eacute;ere to Corbie, where he was staied that night,
for that the common people and pezants mightilie there assembled, hauing gotten
them some head and hartening by meanes of their number that was great, and by
trust of a strength (then ioined vnto them) made of men at armes (manie too tall and
well appointed for fight) all of the garrison of Corbie: a strong towne well walled
and warded. Herevpon at a streict (which they had preoccupied) they stoutlie from
our armie not onelie kept the passage, but also vpon vs gaue a proud onset: wherein
sir Hugh Stafford knight lord Bourghchier, che&eacute;fteine of a wing to the king vnder
his standard of Guien, and as then n&eacute;erest to the enimie, though far inferior in
number, yet with readie and valiant incounter receiued them. The force and slaughter
grew great both on the one side and the other, by the French in especiall, at first right
fiercelie pursued, in so much as with an hardie charge vpon our men, they had both
beat downe the standard, and also from vs quite woone it awaie, to their hie incouragement,
and our incredible despite and dismaie. Whereat one Iohn Bromley
of Bromley in Staffordshire esquier, a n&eacute;ere kinsman vnto the lord Bourghchier, was
euen streight so pearsed at hart, as he could not conteine him, but by and by ran
eagerlie vpon the French; and with his souldiers (in whom wrath and t&eacute;ene had alreadie
inflamed furie and desire of reuenge) did so fiercelie set vpon them, that they
were not onlie beaten backe, but also forced to abandon the place. At this push the capteine cutting through the thickest, strake downe the champion that bare the
standard, and so gloriouslie recouered it againe, and after during the fight (where as
manie of the French lost their liues) couragiouslie ouer his souldiers aduanced it himselfe.
The rest that fled awaie our people pursued in chasing &amp; slaughter vnto Corbie
verie gates. So in victorie, honor, and great ioy, with our small losse (in comparison)
thanks vnto Gods maiestie, the ch&eacute;efteine brought his host into his campe and order
againe. The singular prowes of this worthie capteine the noble man highlie regarding,
in an ample testimonie thereof and vpon his owne honorable consideration, by a
faire ancient d&eacute;ed yet extant at these daies did giue him reward of fortie pounds
annuitie for his life. The monument so plainelie declaring the truth of the matter,
with the maner and dignitie of the feat, as it was doone, hath b&eacute;ene thought verie

<div class="sidenote">King Henrie passeth the riuer of Some with his host.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The kings armie but of 15000.</div>

<p>For that by the armes in the scale it may the better be knowne of what stem
this noble man sproong (a matter which this storie s&eacute;emes iustlie to require) vnderstand
y&eacute;e thus were the same. In his shield, a cheuorne charged with a mullet;
his crest, a swans head couped betw&eacute;ene two wings displaced all out of a crowne
supported by two greihounds; about the sh&eacute;eld ingraven, Signa Hugonis de Stafford
militis. H&eacute;ereby is gathered that he was a third brother of the duke of Buckingham
house. This feat thus well doone, the king the same daie found a shallow,
betw&eacute;ene Corbie and Peron, which neuer was espied before, at which he with his
armie and carriages the night insuing, passed the water of Some without let or
danger, and therewith determined to make haste towards Calis, and not to s&eacute;eke
for battell, except he were thereto constrained, bicause that his armie by sicknesse
was sore diminished, in so much that he had but onelie two thoussand horssemen and
thirt&eacute;ene thousand archers, bilmen, and of all sorts of other footmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">The English armie sore afflicted.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Iustice in warre.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Note the force of iustice.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Hall.</i></div>

<p>The Englishmen were brought into some distresse in this iornie, by reason of
their vittels in maner spent, and no hope to get more: for the enimies had destroied
all the corne before they came. Rest could they none take, for their enimies
with alarmes did euer so infest them: dailie it rained, and nightlie it fr&eacute;esed: of
fuell there was great scarsitie, of fluxes plentie: monie inough, but wares for their
rel&eacute;efe to bestow it on, had they none. Yet in this great necessitie, the poore people
of the countrie were not spoiled, nor anie thing taken of them without paiment, nor
anie outrage or offense doone by the Englishmen, except one, which was, that a
souldier tooke a pix out of a church, for which he was apprehended, and the king
not once remooued till the box was restored, and the offendor strangled. The people
of the countries thereabout, hearing of such zeale in him, to the maintenance of
iustice, ministred to his armie victuals, and other necessaries, although by open
proclamation so to doo they were prohibited.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dolphin king of Sicill.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The French k. sendeth defiance to king Henrie.</div>

<div class="sidenote">K. Henries answer to the defiance.</div>

<p>The French king being at Rone, and hearing that king Henrie was passed the
riuer of Some, was much displeased therewith, and assembling his councell to the
number of fiue and thirtie, asked their aduise what was to be doone. There was
amongst these fiue and thirtie, his sonne the Dolphin, calling himselfe king of
Sicill; the dukes of Berrie and Britaine, the earle of Pontieu the kings yoongest
sonne, and other high estates. At length thirtie of them agr&eacute;ed, that the Englishmen
should not depart vnfought withall, and fiue were of a contrarie opinion, but
the greater number ruled the matter: and so Montioy king at armes was sent to the
king of England to defie him as the enimie of France, and to tell him that he should
shortlie haue battell. King Henrie aduisedlie answered: "Mine intent is to doo as
it pleaseth God, I will not s&eacute;eke your maister at this time; but if he or his s&eacute;eke
me, I will m&eacute;et with them God willing. If anie of your nation attempt once to stop me
in my iournie now towards Calis, at their ieopardie be it; and yet I wish not anie of
you so vnaduised, as to be the occasion that I die your tawnie ground with your red
bloud."</p>

<p>When he had thus answered the herald, he gaue him a princelie reward, and
licence to depart. Vpon whose returne, with this answer, it was incontinentlie on
the French side proclamed, that all men of warre should resort to the constable to
fight with the king of England. Wherevpon, all men apt for armor and desirous of
honour, drew them toward the field. The Dolphin, sore desired to haue b&eacute;ene at the
battell, but he was prohibited by his father: likewise Philip earle of Charolois would
gladlie haue b&eacute;ene there, if his father the duke of Burgognie would haue suffered
him: manie of his men stale awaie, and went to the Frenchmen. The king of England
hearing that the Frenchmen approched, and that there was an other riuer for
him to passe with his armie by a bridge, and doubting least if the same bridge
should be broken, it would be greatlie to his hinderance, appointed certeine capteins
with their bands, to go thither with all sp&eacute;ed before him, and to take possession
thereof, and so to k&eacute;epe it, till his comming thither.</p>

<div class="sidenote">King Henrie rideth foorth to take view of the French armie.</div>

<p>Those that were sent, finding the Frenchmen busie to breake downe their bridge,
assailed them so vigorouslie, that they discomfited them, and tooke and slue them;
and so the bridge was preserued till the king came, and passed the riuer by the
same with his whole armie. This was on the two and twentith day of October.
The duke of Yorke that led the vauntgard (after the armie was passed the riuer)
mounted vp to the heigth of an hill with his people, and sent out scowts to discouer
the countrie, the which vpon their returne aduertised him, that a great armie of
Frenchmen was at hand, approching towards them. The duke declared to the
king what he had heard, and the king therevpon, without all feare or trouble of
mind, caused the battell which he led himselfe to staie, and incontinentlie rode
foorth to view his aduersaries, and that doone, returned to his people, and with
ch&eacute;erefull countenance caused them to be put in order of battell, assigning to euerie
capteine such roome and place, as he thought conuenient, and so kept them still
in that order till night was come, and then determined to s&eacute;eke a place to incampe &amp;
lodge his armie in for that night.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Enguerant.</i></div>

<p>There was not one amongst them that knew any certeine place whither to go, in
that vnknowne countrie: but by chance they happened vpon a beaten waie, white
in sight; by the which they were brought vnto a little village, where they were
refreshed with meat and drinke somewhat more plenteouslie than they had b&eacute;ene
diuerse daies before. Order was taken by commandement from the king after the
armie was first set in battell arraie, that no noise or clamor should be made in the
host; so that in marching foorth to this village, euerie man kept himselfe quiet:
but at their comming into the village, fiers were made to giue light on euerie
side, as there likewise were in the French host, which was incamped not past two hundred
and fiftie pases distant from the English. The ch&eacute;efe leaders of the French host
were these: the constable of France, the marshall, the admerall, the lord Rambures
maister of the crosbowes, and other of the French nobilitie, which came and pitched
downe their standards and banners in the countie of saint Paule, within the territorie
of Agincourt, hauing in their armie (as some write) to the number of thr&eacute;escore
thousand horssemen, besides footmen, wagoners and other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The battell of Agincourt, the 25 of October, 1415.</div>

<p>They were lodged euen in the waie by the which the Englishmen must n&eacute;eds
passe towards Calis, and all that night after their comming thither, made great
cheare, and were verie merie, pleasant, and full of game. The Englishmen also for
their parts were of good comfort, and nothing abashed of the matter, and yet they
were both hungrie, wearie, sore trauelled, and vexed with manie cold diseases. Howbeit
reconciling themselues with God by hoossell and shrift, requiring assistance at
his hands that is the onelie giuer of victorie, they determined rather to die, than to
y&eacute;eld, or fl&eacute;e. The daie following was the fiue and twentith of October in the yeare
1415, being then fridaie, and the feast of Crispine and Crispinian, a daie faire and
fortunate to the English, but most sorrowfull and vnluckie to the French.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The order of the French armie.</div>

<p>In the morning, the French capteins made thr&eacute;e battels, in the vaward were eight
thousand healmes of knights and esquiers, foure thousand archers, and fift&eacute;ene hundred
crosbowes which were guided by the lord de la Breth, constable of France, hauing
with him the dukes of Orleance and Burbon, the earles of Ewe and Richmond,
the marshall Bouciquault, and the maister of the crosbowes, the lord Dampier admerall
of France, and other capteins. The earle of Vandosme with sixt&eacute;ene hundred
men of armes were ordered for a wing to that battell. And the other wing was
guided by sir Guichard Dolphine, sir Clugnet of Brabant, and sir Lewes Bourdon,
with eight hundred men of armes, of elect chosen persons. And to breake the
shot of the Englishmen, were appointed sir Guilliam de Saueuses, with Hector
and Philip his brethren, Ferrie de Maillie, and Allen de Gaspanes, with other eight
hundred of armes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">As manie in the battell.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The French est&eacute;emed six to one English.</div>

<p>In the middle ward, were assigned as manie persons, or more, as were in the formost
battell, and the charge thereof was committed to the dukes of Bar and Alanson, the
earles of Neuers, Vaudemont, Blamont, Salinges, Grant Pr&eacute;e, &amp; of Russie. And
in the rereward were all the other men of armes guided by the earles of Marle, Dampmartine,
Fauconberg, and the lord of Lourreie capteine of Arde, who had with him
the men of the frontiers of Bolonois. Thus the Frenchmen being ordered vnder their
standards and banners, made a great shew: for suerlie they were est&eacute;emed in number
six times as manie or more, than was the whole companie of the Englishmen, with
wagoners, pages and all. They rested themselues, waiting for the bloudie blast of
the terrible trumpet, till the houre betw&eacute;ene nine and ten of the clocke of the same
daie, during which season, the constable made vnto the capteins and other men of
warre a pithie oration, exhorting and incouraging them to doo valiantlie, with manie
comfortable words and sensible reasons. King Henrie also like a leader, and not as
one led; like a souereigne, and not an inferior, perceiuing a plot of ground verie
strong &amp; m&eacute;et for his purpose, which on the backe halfe was fensed with the
village, wherein he had lodged the night before, and on both sides defended with
hedges and bushes, thought good there to imbattell his host, and so ordered his
men in the same place, as he saw occasion, and as stood for his most aduantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The order of the English armie and archers.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The vaward all of archers.</div>

<p>First he sent priuilie two hundred archers into a lowe medow, which was n&eacute;ere
to the vauntgard of his enimies; but separated with a great ditch, commanding
them there to k&eacute;epe themselues close till they had a token to them giuen, to
let driue at their aduersaries: beside this, he appointed a vaward, of the which
he made capteine Edward duke of Yorke, who of an haultie courage had desired
that office, and with him were the lords Beaumont, Willoughbie, and Fanhope, and
this battell was all of archers. The middle ward was gouerned by the king himselfe,
with his brother the duke of Glocester, and the earles of Marshall, Oxenford, and
Suffolke, in the which were all the strong bilmen. The duke of Excester vncle
to the king led the rereward, which was mixed both with bilmen and archers.
The horssemen like wings went on euerie side of the battell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Archers the greatest force of the English armie.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Abr. Fl.</i> out of <i>Fabian</i> pag. 392 and <i>Polychron.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">A politike inuention.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Hall.</i></div>

<p>Thus the king hauing ordered his battels, feared not the puissance of his enimies,
but yet to prouide that they should not with the multitude of horssemen breake
the order of his archers, in whome the force of his armie consisted [&para; For in
those daies the yeomen had their lims at libertie, sith their hosen were then fastened
with one point, and their iackes long and easie to shoot in; so that they might
draw bowes of great strength, and shoot arrowes of a yard long; beside the head]
he caused stakes bound with iron sharpe at both ends, of the length of fiue or six
foot to be pitched before the archers, and of ech side the footmen like an hedge,
to the intent that if the barded horsses ran rashlie vpon them, they might shortlie
be gored and destroied. Certeine persons also were appointed to remooue the stakes,
as by the mooueing of the archers occasion and time should require, so that the
footmen were hedged about with stakes, and the horssemen stood like a bulwarke
betw&eacute;ene them and their enimies, without the stakes. This deuise of fortifieng
an armie, was at this time first inuented: but since that time they haue deuised
caltraps, harrowes, and other new engins against the force of horssemen; so that if the
enimies run hastilie vpon the same, either are their horsses wounded with the
stakes, or their f&eacute;et hurt with the other engins, so as thereby the beasts are gored, or
else made vnable to mainteine their course.</p>

<div class="sidenote">K. Henries oration to his men.</div>

<p>King Henrie, by reason of his small number of people to fill vp his battels, placed
his vauntgard so on the right hand of the maine battell, which himselfe led, that
the distance betwixt them might scarse be perceiued, and so in like case was the
rereward ioined on the left hand, that the one might the more readilie succour
an other in time of n&eacute;ed. When he had thus ordered his battels, he left a small
companie to k&eacute;epe his campe and cariage, which remained still in the village,
and then calling his capteins and soldiers about him, he made to them a right
graue oration, moouing them to plaie the men, whereby to obteine a glorious victorie,
as there was hope certeine they should, the rather if they would but remember
the iust cause for which they fought, and whome they should incounter, such faintharted
people as their ancestors had so often ouercome. To conclude, manie words
of courage he vttered, to stirre them to doo manfullie, assuring them that England
should neuer be charged with his ransome, nor anie Frenchman triumph ouer him
as a captiue; for either by famous death or glorious victorie would he (by Gods
grace) win honour and fame.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A wish.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A noble courage of a valiant prince.</div>

<p>It is said that as he heard one of host vtter his wish to another thus: "I would to
God there were with vs now so manie good soldiers as are at this houre within
England! the king answered: I would not wish a man more here than I haue, we
are ind&eacute;ed in comparison to the enimies but a few, but, if God of his clemencie doo
fauour vs, and our iust cause (as I trust he will) we shall sp&eacute;ed well inough. But let
no man ascribe victorie to our owne strength and might, but onelie to Gods assistance,
to whome I haue no doubt we shall worthilie haue cause to giue thanks therefore.
And if so be that for our offenses sakes we shall be deliuered into the hands of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
enimies, the lesse number we be, the lesse damage shall the realme of England
susteine: but if, we should fight in trust of multitude of men, and so get the victorie
(our minds being prone to pride) we should thervpon peraduenture ascribe the victorie
not so much to the gift of God, as to our owne puissance, and thereby prouoke his
high indignation and displeasure against vs: and if the enimie get the vpper hand,
then should our realme and countrie suffer more damage and stand in further danger.
But be you of good comfort, and shew your selues valiant, God and our iust quarrell
shall defend vs, and deliuer these our proud aduersaries with all the multitude of them
which you s&eacute;e (or at the least the most of them) into our hands." Whilest the king
was yet thus in sp&eacute;ech, either armie so maligned the other, being as then in open sight,
that eueris man cried; Forward, forward. The dukes of Clarence, Glocester, and
Yorke, were of the same opinion, yet the king staied a while, least anie ieopardie
were not fores&eacute;ene, or anie hazard not preuented. The Frenchmen in the meane while,
as though they had b&eacute;ene sure of victorie, made great triumph, for the capteins had
determined before, how to diuide the spoile, and the soldiers the night before had
plaid the Englishmen at dice. The noble men had deuised a chariot, wherein they
might triumphantlie conueie the king captiue to the citie of Paris, crieng to their
soldiers; Haste you to the spoile, glorie and honor; little w&eacute;ening (God wot) how
soone their brags should be blowne awaie.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Hall.</i></div>

<p>Here we may not forget how the French thus in their iolitie, sent an herald to king
Henrie, to inquire what ransome he would offer. Wherevnto he answered, that within
two or thr&eacute;e houres he hoped it would so happen, that the Frenchmen should be
glad to common rather with the Englishmen for their ransoms, than the English to
take thought for their deliuerance, promising for his owne part, that his dead carcasse
should rather be a prize to the Frenchmen, than that his liuing bodie should
paie anie ransome. When the messenger was come backe to the French host, the
men of warre put on their helmets, and caused their trumpets to blow to the battell.
They thought themselues so sure of victorie, that diuerse of the noble men made such
hast towards the battell, that they left manie of their seruants and men of warre
behind them, and some of them would not once staie for their standards: as amongst
other the duke of Brabant, when his standard was not come, caused a baner to be
taken from a trumpet and fastened to a speare, the which he commanded to be borne
before him in st&eacute;ed of his standard.</p>

<p>But when both these armies comming within danger either of other, set in full
order of battell on both sides, they stood still at the first, beholding either others
demeanor, being not distant in sunder past thr&eacute;e bow shoots. And when they had
on both parts thus staied a good while without dooing anie thing, (except that certeine
of the French horsemen aduancing forwards, betwixt both the hosts, were by
the English archers constreined to returne backe) aduise was taken amongst the
Englishmen, what was best for them to doo. Therevpon all things considered, it
was determined, that sith the Frenchmen would not come forward, the king with
his armie imbattelled (as y&eacute;e haue hard) should march towards them, and so leauing
their trusse and baggage in the village where they lodged the night before, onelie
with their weapons, armour, and stakes prepared for the purpose, as y&eacute;e haue
heard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The English gaue the onset.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The two armies ioine battell.</div>

<p>These made somewhat forward, before whome there went an old knight sir Thomas
Erpingham (a man of great experience in the warre) with a warder in his hand;
and when he cast vp his warder, all the armie shouted, but that was a signe to the
archers in the medow, which therwith shot wholie altogither at the vauward of the
Frenchmen, who when they perceiued the archers in the medow, and saw they
could not come at them for a ditch that was betwixt them, with all hast set vpon
the fore ward of king Henrie, but yer they could ioine, the archers in the forefront,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
and the archers on that side which stood in the medow, so wounded the footmen,
galled the horsses, and combred the men of armes, that the footmen durst not go
forward, the horssemen ran togither vpo&#x0304; plumps without order, some ouerthrew such
as were next them, and the horsses ouerthrew their masters, and so at the first
ioining, the Frenchmen were foulie discomforted, and the Englishmen highlie incouraged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The vauward of the French discomfited.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Their battell beaten.</div>

<p>When the French vauward was thus brought to confusion, the English archers
cast awaie their bowes, &amp; tooke into their hands, axes, malls, swords, bils, and other
hand-weapons, and with the same slue the Frenchmen, vntil they came to the middle
ward. Then approched the king, and so incouraged his people, that shortlie the
second battell of the Frenchmen was ouerthrowne, and dispersed, not without great
slaughter of men: howbeit, diuerse were rel&eacute;eued by their varlets, and conueied out
of the field. The Englishmen were so busied in fighting, and taking of the prisoners
at hand, that they followed not in chase of their enimies, nor would once breake
out of their arraie of battell. Yet sundrie of the Frenchmen stronglie withstood
the fiercenesse of the English, when they came to handie strokes, so that the fight
sometime was doubtfull and perillous. Yet as part of the French horssemen set
their course to haue entered vpon the kings battell, with the stakes ouerthrowne,
they were either taken or slaine. Thus this battell continued thr&eacute;e long houres.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A valiant king.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The French rereward discomfited.</div>

<p>The king that daie shewed himselfe a valiant knight, albeit almost felled by the
duke of Alanson; yet with plaine strength he slew two of the dukes companie, and
felled the duke himselfe; whome when he would haue yelded, the kings gard (contrarie
to his mind) slue out of hand. In conclusion, the king minding to make an
end of that daies iornie, caused his horssemen to fetch a compasse about, and to
ioine with him against the rereward of the Frenchmen, in the which was the greatest
number of people. When the Frenchmen perceiued his intent, they were suddenlie
amazed and ran awaie like sh&eacute;epe, without order or arraie. Which when the king
perceiued, he incouraged his men, and followed so quickelie vpon the enimies, that
they ran hither and thither, casting awaie their armour: manie on their kn&eacute;es desired
to haue their liues saued.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The kings campe robbed.</div>

<p>In the meane season, while the battell thus continued, and that the Englishmen
had taken a great number of prisoners, certeine Frenchmen on horssebacke, whereof
were capteins Robinet of Borneuille, Rifflart of Clamas, Isambert of Agincourt,
and other men of armes, to the number of six hundred horssemen, which were the
first that fled, hearing that the English tents &amp; pauillions were a good waie distant
from the armie, without anie sufficient gard to defend the same, either vpon a
couetous meaning to gaine by the spoile, or vpon a desire to be reuenged, entred
vpon the kings campe, and there spoiled the hails, robbed the tents, brake vp chests,
and carried awaie caskets, and slue such seruants as they found to make anie resistance.
For which treason and haskardie in thus leauing their camp at the very point
of fight, for winning of spoile where none to defend it, verie manie were after
committed to prison, and had lost their liues, if the Dolphin had longer liued.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All the prisoners slaine.</div>

<p>But when the outcrie of the lackies and boies, which ran awaie for feare of the
Frenchmen thus spoiling the campe, came to the kings eares, he doubting least his
enimies should gather togither againe, and begin a new field; and mistrusting further
that the prisoners would be an aid to his enimies, or the verie enimies to their
takers in d&eacute;ed if they were suffered to liue, contrarie to his accustomed gentleness,
commanded by sound of trumpet, that euerie man (vpon paine of death) should incontinentlie
slaie his prisoner. When this dolorous decr&eacute;e, and pitifull proclamation
was pronounced, pitie it was to s&eacute;e how some Frenchmen were suddenlie sticked
with daggers, some were brained with pollaxes, some slaine with malls, other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
had their throats cut, and some their bellies panched, so that in effect, hauing
respect to the great number, few prisoners were saued.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A fresh onset.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A right wise and valiant challenge of the king.</div>

<p>When this lamentable slaughter was ended, the Englishmen disposed themselues
in order of battell, readie to abide a new field, and also to inuade, and newlie set
on their enemies, with great force they assailed the carles of Marie and Fauconbridge,
and the lords of Louraie, and of Thine, with six hundred men of armes,
who had all that daie kept togither, but now slaine and beaten downe out of hand.
&para; Some write, that the king perceiuing his enimies in one part to assemble togither,
as though they meant to giue a new battell for preseruation of the prisoners, sent
to them an herald, commanding them either to depart out of his sight, or else to
come forward at once, and giue battel: promising herewith, that if they did offer to
fight againe, not onelie those prisoners which his people alreadie had taken; but also
so manie of them as in this new conflict, which they thus attempted should fall
into his hands, should die the death without redemption.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thanks giuen to God for the victorie.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A woorthie example of a godlie prince.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Titus Liuius.</i></div>

<p>The Frenchmen fearing the sentence of so terrible a decr&eacute;e, without further delaie
parted out of the field. And so about foure of the clocke in the after noone, the king
when he saw no appearance of enimies, caused the retreit to be blowen; and gathering
his armie togither, gaue thanks to almightie God for so happie a victorie, causing
his prelats and chapleins to sing this psalme: In exitu Israel de Aegypto, and commanded
euerie man to kn&eacute;ele downe on the ground at this verse: Non nobis Domine,
non nobis, sed nomini tuo da gloriam. Which doone, he caused Te Deum, with certeine
anthems to be soong, giuing laud and praise to God, without boasting of his
owne force or anie humane power. That night he and his people tooke rest, and refreshed
themsleues with such victuals as they found in the French campe, but lodged
in the same village where he laie the night before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The battell of Agincourt.</div>

<p>In the morning, Montioie king at armes and foure other French heralds came to
the K. to know the number of prisoners, and to desire buriall for the dead. Before
he made them answer (to vnderstand what they would saie) he demanded of them
whie they made to him that request, considering that he knew not whether the victorie
was his or theirs? When Montioie by true and iust confession had cl&eacute;ered that
doubt to the high praise of the king, he desired of Montioie to vnderstand the name
of the castell n&eacute;ere adioining: when they had told him that it was called Agincourt,
he said, Then shall this conflict be called the battell of Agincourt. He feasted the
French officers of armes that daie, and granted them their request, which busilie
sought throngh the field for such as were slaine. But the Englishmen suffered them
not to go alone, for they searched with them, &amp; found manie hurt, but not in ieopardie
of their liues, whom they tooke prisoners, and brought them to their tents. When
the king of England had well refreshed himselfe, and his souldiers, that had taken
the spoile of such as were slaine, he with his prisoners in good order returned to his
towne of Calis.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The same day that the new maior went to Westminster to receiue his oth, the aduertisement of this noble victorie came to the citie in the morning betimes yer men were vp from their beds.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Thr&eacute;e graues that held fiue thousand and eight hundred corpses.</div>

<p>When tidings of this great victorie was blowne into England, solemne processions
and other praisings to almightie God with boune-fires and ioifull triumphes, were
ordeined in euerie towne, citie, and burrow, and the maior &amp; citizens of London went
the morow after the daie of saint Simon and Iude from the church of saint Paule to
the church of saint Peter at Westminster in deuout maner, rendring to God hartie
thanks for such fortunate lucke sent to the king and his armie. The same sundaie
that the king remooued from the campe at Agincourt towards Calis, diuerse Frenchmen
came to the field to view againe the dead bodies; and the pezants of the countrie
spoiled the carcasses of all such apparell and other things as the Englishmen had
left: who tooke nothing but gold and siluer, iewels, rich apparell and costlie armour.
But the plowmen and pezants left nothing behind, neither shirt nor clout: so that
the bodies laie starke naked vntill wednesdaie. On the which daie diuerse of the
noble men were conueied into their countries, and the remnant were by Philip earle
Charolois (sore lamenting the chance, and mooued with pitie) at his costs &amp; charges
buried in a square plot of ground of fift&eacute;ene hundred yards; in the which he caused to
be made thr&eacute;e pits, wherein were buried by account fiue thousand and eight hundred
persons, beside them that were caried awaie by their fr&eacute;ends and seruants, and others,
which being wounded died in hospitals and other places.</p>

<p>After this their dolorous iournie &amp; pitifull slaughter, diuerse clearks of Paris made
manie a lamentable verse, complaining that the king reigned by will, and that councellors
were parciall, affirming that the noble men fled against nature, and that the
commons were destroied by their prodigalitie, declaring also that the cleargie were
dumbe, and durst not saie the truth, and that the humble commons dulie obeied, &amp; yet
euer suffered punishment, for which cause by diuine persecution the lesse number
vanquished the greater: wherefore they concluded, that all things went out of order,
and yet was there no man that studied to bring the vnrulie to frame. It was no
maruell though this battell was lamentable to the French nation, for in it were taken
and slaine the flower of all the nobilitie of France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Noble men prisoners.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The number slaine on the French part.</div>

<p>There were taken prisoners, Charles duke of Orleance nephue to the French king,
Iohn duke of Burbon, the lord Bouciqualt one of the marshals of France (he after
died in England) with a number of other lords, knights, and esquiers, at the least fift&eacute;ene
hundred, besides the common people. There were slaine in all of the French
part to the number of ten thousand men, whereof were princes and noble men bearing
baners one hundred twentie and six; to these of knights, esquiers, and gentlemen, so
manie as made vp the number of eight thousand and foure hundred (of the which
fiue hundred were dubbed knights the night before the battell) so as of the meaner
sort, not past sixt&eacute;ene hundred. Amongst those of the nobilitie that were slaine,
these were the ch&eacute;efest, Charles lord de la Breth high constable of France, Iaques of
Chatilon lord of Dampier admerall of France, the lord Rambures master of the crossebowes,
sir Guischard Dolphin great master of France, Iohn duke of Alanson, Anthonie
duke of Brabant brother to the duke of Burgognie, Edward duke of Bar, the earle
of Neuers an other brother to the duke of Burgognie, with the erles of Marle, Vaudemont,

<p>Of Englishmen, there died at this battell, Edward duke Yorke, the earle of Suffolke,
sir Richard Kikelie, and Dauie Gamme esquier, and of all other not aboue fiue and
twentie persons, as some doo report; but other writers of greater credit affirme, that
there were slaine aboue fiue or six hundred persons. Titus Liuius saith, that there
were slaine of Englishmen, beside the duke of Yorke, and the earle of Suffolke, an
hundred persons at the first incounter. The duke of Glocester the kings brother was
sore wounded about the hips, and borne downe to the ground, so that he fell backwards,
with his f&eacute;et towards his enimies, whom the king bestrid, and like a brother
valiantlie rescued from his enimies, &amp; so sauing his life, caused him to be conueied
out of the fight, into a place of more safetie. &para; The whole order of this conflict which
cost manie a mans life, and procured great bloudshed before it was ended, is liuelie described

<p>After that the king of England had refreshed himselfe, and his people at Calis,
and that such prisoners as he had left at Harflue (as ye haue heard) were come to
Calis vnto him, the sixt daie of Nouember, he with all his prisoners tooke shipping,
and the same daie landed at Douer, hauing with him the dead bodies of the duke of
Yorke, and the earle of Suffolke, and caused the duke to be buried at his colledge of
Fodringhey, and the earle at new Elme. In this passage, the seas were so rough
and troublous that two ships belonging to sir Iohn Cornewall, lord Fanhope, were
driuen into Zeland; howbeit, nothing was lost, nor any person perisht. &para; The maior
of London, and the aldermen, apparelled in orient grained scarlet, and foure hundred
commoners clad in beautifull murrie, well mounted, and trimlie horssed, with rich
collars, &amp; great chaines, met the king on Blackheath, reioising at his returne: and
the clergie of London, with rich crosses, sumptuous copes, and massie censers, receiued
him at saint Thomas of Waterings with solemne procession.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Part of those that spoiled the English campe.</div>

<p>The king like a graue and sober personage, and as one remembring from whome all
victories are sent, s&eacute;emed little to regard such vaine pompe and shewes as were in
triumphant sort deuised for his welcomming home from so prosperous a iournie, in so
much that he would not suffer his helmet to be caried with him, whereby might haue
appeared to the people the blowes and dints that were to be s&eacute;ene in the same; neither
would he suffer any ditties to be made and soong by minstrels of his glorious victorie,
for that he would wholie haue the praise and thanks altogither giuen to God. The
news of this bloudie battell being reported to the French king as then soiourning at
Rone, filled the court full of sorrow. But to remedie such danger as was like to
insue, it was decr&eacute;ed by councell, to ordeine new officers in places of them that were
slaine: and first he elected his chiefe officer for the wars, called the constable, the
earle of Arminacke, a wise and politike capteine, and an ancient enimie to the
Englishmen. Sir Iohn de Corsie was made maister of the crossebowes. Shortlie
after, either for melancholie that he had for the losse at Agincourt, or by some sudden
disease Lewes Dolphin of Viennois, heire apparant to the French king, departed this
life without issue, which happened well for Robinet of Bourneuill, and his fellowes,
as ye haue heard before, for his death was their life, &amp; his life would haue b&eacute;ene
their death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A sore conflict.</div>

<p>After the French king had created new officers, in hope to relieue the state of his
realme and countrie, sore shaken by the late great ouerthrow, it chanced, that Thomas
duke of Excester capteine of Harflue, accompanied with thr&eacute;e thousand Englishmen,
made a great rode into Normandie, almost to the citie of Rone, in which iournie he
got great abundance both of riches and prisoners: but in his returne, the earle of
Arminacke newlie made constable of France, intending in his first enterprise to win
the spurs, hauing with him aboue fiue thousand horssemen, incountred with the duke.
The fight was handled on both parts verie hotlie, but bicause the Englishmen were
not able to resist the force of the Frenchmen, the duke was constreined to retire with
losse at the least of thr&eacute;e hundred of his footmen.</p>

<p>Howbeit being withdrawen into an orchard, which was stronglie fensed and hedged
about with thornes, the Frenchmen were not able to enter vpon the Englishmen;
but yet they tooke from them all their horsses and spoile, &amp; assaulted them till
it was night, and then retired backe to the towne, not far distant from the place
where they fought, called Vallemont: this was vpon the 14 day of March. In
the morning vpon the breake of the daie, the Englishmen issued foorth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>

wherof the Frenchmen being aduertised, followed them, &amp; ouertooke them vpon
the sands n&eacute;ere to Chiefe de Caux, and there set on them: but in the end, the
Frenchmen were discomfited, and a great number of them slaine by the Englishmen,
which afterwards returned without more adoo vnto Harflue. The French writers
blame the constable for this losse, bicause he kept on the high ground with a number
of men of war, and would not come downe to aid his fellowes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Titus Liuius.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The strange manner of receiuing the emperour at Douer.</div>

<p>In this fourth yeare of king Henries reigne, the emperour Sigismund, coosine
germane to king Henrie, came into England, to the intent that he might make
an attonement betw&eacute;ene king Henrie and the French king: with whom he had
b&eacute;ene before, bringing with him the archbishop of Remes, as ambassadour for the
French king. At Calis he was honorablie receiued by the earle of Warwike lord
deputie there, and diuerse other lords sent thither of purpose to attend him. Moreouer,
the king sent thither thirtie great ships to bring him and his traine ouer.
At Douer the duke of Glocester, and diuerse other lords were readie to receiue
him, who at his approching to land, entered the water with their swords in their
hands drawen; and by the mouth of the said duke declared to him, that if he
intended to enter the land as the kings fr&eacute;end, and as a mediator to intreat for
peace, he should be suffered to arriue: but if he would enter as an emperour into
a land claimed to be vnder his empire, then were they readie to resist him. This
was thought necessarie to be doone for sauing of the kings prerogatiue, who hath full
preheminence within his owne realme, as an absolute emperour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Albert duke of Holland co&#x0304;meth into England.</div>

<p>When the emperour herevpon answered that he was come as the kings fr&eacute;end,
and as a mediator for peace, and not with any imperiall authoritie, he was of
the duke and other his associats receiued with all such honor as might be deuised.
The king with all his nobilitie receiued him on Blackheath the seuenth day of Maie,
and brought him through London to Westminster with great triumph. Shortlie
after there came also into England Albert duke of Holland, who was likewise fr&eacute;endlie
interteined. Both these princes, the emperour and the duke of Holland were
conueied to Windsore to saint Georges feast, and elected companions of the noble
order of the garter, and had the collar and habit of the same to them deliuered, and
sat in their stals all the solemnitie of the feast. Shortlie after that the feast was
finished, the duke of Holland returned into his countrie; but the emperour tarried
still, and assaied all maner of meanes to persuade the king to a peace with the
Frenchmen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The emperor an earnest mediator for peace.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Harflue besieged by the French.</div>

<p>But their euill hap, as they that were appointed by Gods prouidence to suffer
more damage at the Englishmens hands, would not permit his persuasions to take
place: for whereas peace was euen almost entring in at the gates, the king was suddenlie
stirred to displeasure vpon a new occasion, for he being aduertised of the losse
of his men at the late conflict in the territorie of Rone (as ye haue heard) refused
to heare this word peace once named. The emperour like a wise prince passed ouer
that time till another season, that some fauourable aspect of the planets should
s&eacute;eme to further his purpose. And when he thought the same was come, he broched
againe the vessell of concord and amitie, which he put in so faire a cup, and presented
it with such effectuous words, that suerlie the king had tasted it, if word
had not b&eacute;en brought about the same time that Harflue was besieged of the French
both by water and land, as it was in d&eacute;ed: for the constable of France incouraged by
his last conflict (though the same was not much to his praise) assembled an armie,
and vpon a sudden laid siege to the towne. At the same instant Iohn vicount of
Narbon the vice-admerall of France, brought the whole nauie to the riuage and
shore adioining to the towne, in purpose to haue entered by the waterside; but the
duke of Excester defeated his intent, and defended the towne verie manfullie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A great ouerthrow by sea giuen to the French by the duke of Bedford.</div>

<p>King Henrie aduertised hereof, meant at the first to haue gone with his nauie in
person to the succors of his men; but the emperor dissuaded him from that purpose,
aduising him rather to send some one of his capteins. The king following his louing
and reasonable aduertisement, appointed his brother the duke of Bedford accompanied
with the earles of March, Marshall, Oxford, Huntington, Warwike, Arundell,
Salisburie, Deuonshire, and diuerse barons, with two hundred saile, to passe into Normandie,
for rescue of the towne of Harflue; which vsing great diligence shipped at
Rie, and after some hinderance by contrarie winds, at length came to the mouth of
the riuer of Seine on the daie of the Assumption of our ladie. When the vicount of
Narbon perceiued the English nauie to approch, he couragiouslie set forward, and gat
the possession of the mouth of the hauen. The duke of Bedford s&eacute;eing his enimies
thus fiercelie to come forward, set before certeine strong ships which at the first incounter
vanquished and tooke two French ships, the capteins whereof were too rash and
forward.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Harflue rescued by the Englishmen.</div>

<p>The duke followed with all his puissance, and set on his enimies. The fight was
long, but not so long as perillous, nor so perillous as terrible (for battels on the sea are
desperate) till at length the victorie fell to the Englishmen, so that almost all the
whole nauie of France, in the which were manie ships, hulkes, carikes, and other small
vessels, to the number of fiue was sunke &amp; taken. Amongst other vessels that were
taken, thr&eacute;e great carikes of Genoa, a citie in Italie, were sent into England. In
the same conflict were slaine of the Frenchmen no small number, as appeared by the dead
bodies, which were s&eacute;ene euerie daie swimming about the English ships. After this,
the duke of Bedford sailed vp to Harflue, &amp; refreshed the towne both with vittels and
monie; notwitstanding certeine other French gallies did what they could to haue
letted that enterprise. When the earle of Arminacke heard that the puissant name
of France was vanquished, he raised his siege &amp; returned to Paris.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ciuill discord amongst the nobles of France.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Charles the French king not of sound memorie.</div>

<p>After this discomfiture and losse, the puissance of the Frenchmen began to decaie,
for now the princes and nobles of the realme fell into diuision and discord among
themselues, studieng how to reuenge their old priuat iniuries, &amp; refused to take paine
for succour of the publike weale and safegard of their countrie: wherevpon their
power began to wax slender, their state brought into imminent danger of perpetuall
bondage; which thing no doubt had fallen vpon them if king Henrie had longer liued.
For as vpon once inconuenience suffered, manie doo follow, so was it in France at
that time: for the king was not of sound memorie, the warre that was toward both
doubtfull and perillous: the princes vntrustie and at discord: with a hundred
things more (which might bring a realme to ruine) out of frame and order in France
in those daies. After that the duke of Bedford was returned backe againe into England
with great triumph and glorie, he was not so much thanked of the king
his brother, as praised of the emperour Sigismund, being to him a stranger, which
said openlie, that happie are those subiects which haue such a king, but more happie
is the king that hath such subiects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The emperor entereth into league with king Henrie.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The co&#x0304;tents of the league.</div>

<p>When the emperor perceiued that it was in vaine to mooue further for peace, he
left off that treatie, and entered himselfe into a league with king Henrie, the contents
of which league consisted ch&eacute;eflie in these articles, that both the said emperour
and king, their heires, and successors, should be fr&eacute;ends ech to other, as alies and
confederats against all manner of persons, of what estate or d&eacute;gr&eacute;e so euer they
were (the church of Rome, and the pope for that time being onlie excepted) and that
neither they, nor their heires, nor successors should be present in councell or other
place, where either of them, or his heires or successors might susteine damage, in
lands, goods, honors, states, or persons: and that if anie of them should vnderstand
of losse or hinderance to be like to fall or happen to the others, they should
impeach the same, or if that laie not in their powers, they should aduertise the others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
thereof with all conuenient sp&eacute;ed: and that either of them, and their heires and
successors should aduance the others honor and commoditie without fraud or
deceipt. Moreouer, that neither of them, nor their heires and successors should
permit their subiects to leauie warres against the others, and that it should be lawfull
and fr&eacute;e for ech of their subiects, to passe into the others countrie, and there to
remaine and make merchandize, either by sea or land, paieng the customes, gabels,
and duties due and accustomed, according to the lawes and ordinances of the
places and countries where they chanced to traffike.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Titus Liuius.</i></div>

<p>Furthermore, that neither of the said princes, nor their heires nor successors
should receiue any rebell, banished man, or traitor of the others wittinglie; but
should cause euerie such person to auoid out of their countries, realmes, dominions,
and iurisdictions. Againe, that neither of the said princes, their heires, nor
successors should begin any wars against any other person, other than such as they
had warres with at that present, without consent of the other his confederate, except
in defence of themselues, their countries and subiects, in case of inuasion made vpon
them. Also, that it should be lawful for the king of England, to prosecute his
warres against the Frenchmen for recouerie of his right, as should s&eacute;eme to
him expedient; and likewise to the emperor, for recouerie of any part of his right
in France, so that neither of them did preiudice the others right in that behalfe.
Lastlie, that either of them should assist other, in recouerie &amp; conquest of their
rights, lands, and dominions, occupied, withholden, and kept from them, by him
that called himselfe king of France, and other the princes and barons of France.
This aliance, with other conditions, agr&eacute;ements, and articles, was concluded &amp; established
on the ninet&eacute;enth daie of October, in the yeare of our Lord 1416. This
doone, the emperor returned homewards, to passe into Germanie; and the king
partlie to shew him honor, and partlie bicause of his owne affaires, associated him to
his towne of Calis.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A truce betw&eacute;ene the k. and the duke of Burgognie.</div>

<p>During the time of their abode there, the duke of Burgognie offered to come to
Calis, to speake with the emperor and the king, bicause he had knowledge of the
league that was concluded betwixt them: the king sent his brother the duke of
Glocester, and the earle of March to the water of Graueling, to be hostages for the
duke of Burgognie: and also the earle of Warwike, with a noble companie to conduct
him to his presence. At Graueling foord the dukes met, and after salutations
doone, the duke of Burgognie was conueied to Calis, where of the emperor and the
king he was highly welcomed and feasted. Here is to be noted, that in Iune last,
the king of England had sent the earle of Warwike, and other, vnto the duke of
Burgognie, as then remaining at Lisle, where by the diligent trauell of those English
ambassadors, a truce was concluded betwixt the king of England and the duke
of Burgognie, touching onelie the counties of Flanders and Arthois, to indure from
the feast of saint Iohn Baptist in that present yeare 1416, vnto the feast of saint
Michaell, in the yeare next insuing. Which truce at the dukes being now at Calis
(when no further agr&eacute;ement could be concluded) was prolonged vnto the feast of saint
Michaell, that should be in the yeare 1419. The duke of Glocester was receiued at
Graueling, by the earle Charolois, and by him honorablie conueied to saint Omers, and
there lodged that night.</p>

<p>The next day, the earle Charolois came with diuerse noble men, to visit the duke
of Glocester in his lodging, and when he entered into the chamber, the dukes backe
was towards him, talking with some one of his seruants, and did not s&eacute;e nor welcome
the earle at his first entrie; but after he said to him shortlie without any
great reuerence, or comming towards him; You be welcome faire cousine, and so
passed foorth his tale with his seruants. The earle Charolois for all his youth, was
not well content therewith, but yet suffered for that time. When the duke of Bur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>gognie
had doone all his businesse at Calis, after the ninth daie he returned to
Graueling, where the duke of Glocester and he met againe, and louinglie departed,
the one to Calis, and the other to saint Omers; for the which voiage the duke of
Burgognie was suspected to be enemie to the crowne of France. After the dukes
departing from Calis, the emperor was highlie feasted and rewarded, and at his pleasure
sailed into Holland, &amp; so rode towards Beame. The king likewise tooke ship,
and returned into England on saint Lukes euen.</p>

furthermore the great discord and ciuill dissention which reigned amongst the

the warres now in hand against them, and that without delaie. He therefore
desired them to prouide for monie and treasure, that nothing should be wanting when

In this parlement also Iohn Duke of Bedford was made gouernour

that led the fore ward, had the charge of that siege, the which by force of assaults,
and other warlike meanes, brought to that point, that they within y&eacute;elded the place
into his hands, the ninth daie of August.
The earle of Salisburie, who led the
battell, tooke the castell of Amberuilliers, the which was giuen to him by the king,
and so this earle was the first that had anie territorie giuen him of the king in this
new conquest. The king made at the winning of Touque eight and twentie knights,
and left sir Robert Kirkelie capteine there.</p>

<p>After this, on deliberate aduise taken how to proc&eacute;ed, the k. set forward toward
the towne of Caen in most warlike order, wasting the countrie on euerie side as he
passed. Which towne standeth in a plaine fertile countrie, no stronger walled, than
d&eacute;epe ditched, and as then well vittelled and replenished with people: for the citizens
fearing the kings comming, had there prouided all things necessarie and defensible.
But his maiestie doubting least the Frenchmen, vpon their vnderstanding of
his approch to the towne, would haue burned the suburbs and buildings without the
walles, sent the duke of Clarence with a thousand men before him, to preuent that
misch&eacute;efe. The duke comming thither, found the suburbs alreadie set on fire, but
vsed such diligence to quench the same, that the most part was saued. He also wan
the abbeie church of saint Stephan, which the Frenchmen were in hand to haue
ouerthrowne, by vndermining the pillers; but the duke obteining the place, filled vp
the mines, and so preserued the church. He also wan a cell of nunnes, verie stronglie
fensed, after the manner of warre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Caen besieged.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The order of the assault.</div>

<p>Then came the king before the towne, who caused foorthwith to be cast a d&eacute;epe
trench, with an high mount, to k&eacute;epe them within from issuing foorth, and that
doone, began fiercelie to assault the towne: but they within stood manfullie to their
defense, so that there was sore and cruell fight betwixt them, and their enimies.
But when king Henrie perceiued that he lost more than he wan by his dailie assaults,
he left off anie more to assault it, and determined to ouerthrow the wals, with vndermining.
Wherefore with all diligence, the pioners cast trenches, made mines,
and brought timber: so that within a few daies, the wals stood onelie vpon posts,
readie to fall, when fire should be put to them.
The king meaning now to giue
a generall assault, caused all the capteins to assemble before him in councell, vnto
whome he declared his purpose, commanding them not before the next daie to vtter
it; till by sound of trumpet they should haue warning to set forward towards the
wals, least his determination being disclosed to the enimies, might cause them to
prouide the better for their owne defense.
He also prescribed vnto them, what order
he would haue them to k&eacute;epe, in giuing the assault, and that was this; that euerie
capteine deuiding his band into thr&eacute;e seuerall portions, they might be readie one to
succ&eacute;ed in an others place, as those which fought should happilie be driuen backe
and repelled.</p>

<p>In the morning next following, being the fourth of September, somewhat before
the breake of the daie, he caused his people to approch the wals, and to shew
countenance, as though they would giue a generall assault; and whilest they were
busied in assailing and defending on both sides, the Englishmen pearsed and brake
thorough the wals by diuerse holes and ouertures made by the pioners, vnder the
foundation: yet the king vpon diuerse respects, offered them within pardon of life
if they would y&eacute;eld themselues and the towne to his mercie; but they refusing
that to doo, the assault was newlie begun, and after sore fight continued for the
space of an houre, the Englishmen preuailed, and slew so manie as they found
with weapon in hand, readie to resist them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Titus Liuius.</i></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Caen taken by the Englishmen.</div>

<p>The duke of Clarence was the first that entred with his people, and hauing got
the one part of the towne, assailed them that kept the bridge, &amp; by force beating
them backe, passed the same, and so came to the wals on the other side of the towne,
where the fight was sharpe and fierce betwixt the assailants and defendants; but the
duke with his people setting on the Frenchmen behind, as they stood at defense on
the wals, easilie vanquished them, so that the Englishmen entred at their pleasure.
Thus when the king was possessed of the towne, he incontinentlie commanded all
armours &amp; weapons of the vanquished, to be brought into one place, which was
immediatlie doone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diuision of spoile.</div>

<p>Then the miserable people came before the kings presence, and kn&eacute;eling on their
kn&eacute;es, held vp their hands, and cried; Mercie, mercie: to whome the king gaue
certeine comfortable words, &amp; bad them stand vp. All the night following, he
caused his armie to k&eacute;epe themselues in order of battell within the towne, and on
the next morning called all the magistrats &amp; gouernors of the towne to the senat house,
where some for their wilfull stubbornesse were adiudged to die, other were sore fined
and ransomed.
Then he calling togither his souldiers and men of warre, not onelie
gaue them great praises and high commendations for their manlie dooings, but also
distributed to euerie man, according to his desert, the spoile and game gotten in
the towne, ch&eacute;eflie bicause at the assault they had shewed good proofe of their manhood
and valiant courages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The capteine of the castell held out.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Titus Liuius.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">Caen castell y&eacute;elded.</div>

<p>After that the towne was thus woone, the lord Montainie, capteine of the castell,
would not y&eacute;eld, but made semblance, as though he meant to defend the place,
to the vtterance: but after that he was sharplie called vpon by king Henrie, either
to y&eacute;eld it, or else that he should be assured to haue all mercie and fauour sequestred
from him, he tooke better aduise, and therevpon being in despaire of
rel&eacute;efe, made this composition, that if he were not rescued of the French power by
a certeine daie, he should render the fortresse into the kings hands, with condition,
that he and his souldiers should be suffered to depart with all their goods, the
habiliments of warre onelie excepted.
Herevpon twelue hostages were deliuered to
the king, and when the daie came, being the twentith of September, they within
rendred the castell into the kings hands; and thus, both the towne and castell
of Caen became English.</p>

<p>Whilest the king was thus occupied about his warres in Normandie, the Scots in
great number, entring England, wasted the countrie with fire and sword whersoeuer
they came.
The English lords that were left in trust with the k&eacute;eping of those
parties of the realme, raised the whole power of the countries, so that there came
togither the number of an hundred thousand men vpon Baw moore, where the generall
assemblie was made, and as it chanced, the duke of Excester, vncle to the king, who had
latelie before mustered a certeine number of men to conueie them ouer to the king as
a new supplie to his armie there, was the same time in the north parts on pilgrimage
at Bridlington; and hearing of this inuasion made by the Scots, tooke vpon him to be
generall of the armie prepared against them, and to giue them battell. Also, the
archbishop of Yorke, although he was not able to sit on horssebacke by reason of his
great age, caused himselfe to be caried foorth in a charet in that iournie, the better to
incourage other.
But the Scots hearing that the Englishmen approched toward them
with such puissance, withdrew backe into their countrie, and durst not abide the
bickering; either because they mistrusted an infortunat euent on their side, by reason
of the English prowesse; or else for that they had learned by others ouerthrowes to

The abbats seruants getting knowledge hereof, came thither by night, but they missed

caried streict to prison. The lord Cobham herewith was sore dismaied, for that
some of them that were taken were such as he trusted most, being of counsell in all

those books in times past had b&eacute;ene trimlie gilt, limned, and beautified with images,
the heads whereof had b&eacute;ene scraped off, and in the Letanie they had boltted foorth the

<div class="sidenote">Commendation of the Dolphin of France.</div>

<p>In this meane time that the king of England was occupied about Caen, the Frenchmen
had neither anie sufficient power to resist him, nor were able to assemble an host
togither in their necessitie, by reason of the dissention among themselues: for their
king was so simple, that he was spoiled both of treasure and kingdome, so that euerie
man spent and wasted he cared not what.
Charles the Dolphin being of the age
of sixt&eacute;ene or seauent&eacute;ene yeares, bewailed the ruine and decaie or his countrie,
he onelie studied the rel&eacute;efe of the common-wealth, and deuised how to resist his
enimies; but hauing neither men nor monie, was greatlie troubled and disquieted
in mind. In conclusion, by the aduise and counsell of the earle of Arminacke
the constable of France, he found a meane to get all the treasure &amp; riches which
his moother qu&eacute;ene Isabell had gotten and hoorded in diuerse secret places: and
for the common defense and profit of his countrie he wiselie bestowed it in waging
souldiers, and preparing of things necessarie for the warre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The yoong Dolphin fl&eacute;eced his old moother of hir treasure, what misch&eacute;efe rose vpon it.</div>

husband Iohn duke of Burgognie in the highest authoritie about the king, giuing
him the regiment and direction of the king and his realme, with all preheminence
&amp; souereigntie.
The duke of Burgognie hauing the sword in his hand, in reuenge
of old iniuries, began to make warre on the Dolphin, determining, that when he
had tamed this yoong vnbrideled gentleman, then would he go about to withstand,
and beat backe the common enimies of the realme. The like reason mooued the
Dolphin, for he minded first to represse the authours of ciuill discord, before he
would set vpon forreine enimies, and therefore prepared to subdue and destroie
the duke of Burgognie, as the ch&eacute;efe head of that misch&eacute;efe, whereby the realme
was vnquieted, decaied, and in manner brought to vtter ruine. Thus was France
afflicted, and in euerie part troubled with warre and diuision, and no man to prouide

towne of Baieux, whereof the lord Matreuers was appointed capteine.
The duke
of Glocester also finding small resistance, tooke the citie of Liseaux, of which citie
sir Iohn Kirkleie was ordeined capteine. King Henrie himselfe taried still at Caen,
fortifieng the towne and castell, and put out fift&eacute;ene hundred women and impotent
persons, replenishing the towne with English people.
Where while the king soiourned,
he kept a solemne feast, and made manie knights; beside that, he shewed there
an example of great pitie and clemencie: for in searching the castell, he found
innumerable substance of plate and monie belonging to the citizens, whereof he
would not suffer one penie to be touched, but restored the same to the owners, deliuering
to euerie man that which was his owne.</p>

the capteins of the townes adioining, came willinglie to his presence, offering to him
themselues, their townes, and their goods, whervpon he made proclamation, that all
men, which had, or would become his subiects, and sweare to him allegiance, should
inioy their goods, and liberties, in as large or more ample maner, than they did before:
which gentle interteining of the stubborne Normans, was the verie cause, why
they were not onlie content, but also glad to remooue and turne from the French part,
and become subiects to the crowne of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The voluntarie subiection of the French.</div>

<p>When the king had set Caen in good order, he left there for capteins, the one of the
towne, the other of the castell, sir Gilbert Umfreuill earle of Kime or Angus, &amp; sir
Gilbert Talbot, and made bailiffe there sir Iohn Popham, and so departed from Caen
the first of October, and comming to the castell of Courfie, within thr&eacute;e daies had it
rendred to him.
From whence, the fourth of October, he came vnto Argenton; they
within that towne and castell offered, that if no rescue came by a daie limited, they
would deliuer both the towne and castell into the kings hands, so that such as would
abide and become the kings faithfull subiects should be receiued, the other to depart
with their goods and liues saued whither they would: the king accepted their offer.
When the daie limited came, and no succours appeared, they y&eacute;elded according to the
couenants, and the king performed all that on his behalfe was promised. The lord
Graie of Codnor was appointed capteine there. After this, resorted dailie to the king,
of the Normans, people of all sorts and degr&eacute;es, to sweare to him fealtie and homage.

<div class="sidenote">Alanson besieged and y&eacute;elded vp.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Titus Liuius.</i></div>

<p>The towne of Alanson abode a siege for the space of eight daies; they within defending
it right valiantlie at the first; but in the end, considering with themselues, what small
hope there was for anie succours to come to remooue the siege, they grew to a composition,
that if within a certeine daie they were not rel&eacute;eued, they should y&eacute;eld both
the towne and castell into the kings hands, which was doone: for no succours could
be heard of. The king appointed capteine of this towne, the duke of Glocester, and
his lieutenant sir Ralfe Lentall.
The duke of Britaine vnder safe conduct came to the
king, as he was thus busie in the conquest of Normandie, and after sundrie points
treated of betwixt them, a truce was taken, to indure from the seuenth daie of Nouember,
vnto the last of September, in the yeare next following, betwixt them, their souldiers,
men of warre, and subiects. The like truce was granted vnto the qu&eacute;ene of
Ierusalem and Sicill, &amp; to hir sonne Lewes, for the duchie of Aniou, and the countie
of Maine, the duke of Britaine being their deputie for concluding of the same
truce.</p>

<p>About the same time also, at the sute of Charles the Dolphin, a treatie was in hand
at Touque, for a finall peace, but it came to none effect. From Alanson the king set
forward towards the towne and castell of Faleis, meaning to besiege the same, where
the Frenchmen appointed to the k&eacute;eping of it, had fortified the towne by all meanes
possible, and prepared themselues to defend it to the vttermost. The earle of Salisburie
was first sent thither before with certeine bands of souldiers to inclose the enimies
within the towne, &amp; to view the strength thereof. After him came the king with his
whole armie, about the first of December, and then was the towne besieged on ech
side.
The king lodged before the gate that leadeth to Caen, the duke of Clarence
before the castell that standeth on a rocke and the duke of Glocester laie on the kings
right hand, and other lords &amp; noble men were assigned to their places as was thought
expedient. And to be sure from taking damage by anie sudden inuasion of the eni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>mies,
there were great trenches and rampiers cast and made about their seuerall

<p>The Frenchmen notwithstanding this siege, valiantlie defended their wals, and
sometimes made issues foorth, but small to their gaine: and still the Englishmen with
their guns and great ordinance made batterie to the wals and bulworks. The winter
season was verie cold, with sharpe frost, &amp; hard weather; but the Englishmen made
such shift for prouision of all things necessarie to serue their turns, that they were
sufficientlie prouided, both against hunger and cold: so that in the end, the Frenchmen
perceiuing they could not long indure against them, offered to talke, and agr&eacute;ed
to giue ouer the towne, if no rescue came by a certeine daie appointed. About the
same season was sir Iohn Oldcastell, lord Cobham taken, in the countrie of Powes
land, in the borders of Wales, within a lordship belonging to the lord Powes, not without
danger and hurts of some that were at the taking of him: for they could not take
him, till he was wounded himselfe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Iohn Oldcastell executed.</div>

<p>At the same time, the states of the realme were assembled at London, for the leuieng
of monie, to furnish the kings great charges, which he was at about the maintenance
of his wars in France: it was therefore determined, that the said sir Iohn
Oldcastell should be brought, and put to his triall, yer the assemblie brake vp. The
lord Powes therefore was sent to fetch him, who brought him to London in a litter,
wounded as he was: herewith, being first laid fast in the Tower, shortlie after he was
brought before the duke of Bedford, regent of the realme, and the other estates, where
in the end he was condemned; and finallie was drawen from the Tower vnto saint Giles

the towne was y&eacute;elded to the king: but the castell held out still, into the which
the capteine and gouernour both of the towne and castell had withdrawne themselues,
with all the souldiers; and being streictlie besieged, the capteine defended
himselfe and the place right stoutlie, although he was sore laid to, vntill at length,
perceiuing his people wearied with continuall assaults, and such approches as were
made to and within the verie wals, he was driuen to compound with the king, that
if he were not succoured by the sixt of Februarie, then should he y&eacute;eld himselfe prisoner,
and deliuer the castell; so that the souldiers should haue licence to depart,
with their liues onelie saued. When the daie came, the couenants were performed,
and the castell rendered to the kings hands, for no aid came to the rescue of them
within. The capteine named Oliuer de Mannie was kept as prisoner, till the castell
was repared at his costs and charges, because the same, through his obstinat wilfulnesse,
was sore beaten and defaced, with vnderminings and batterie. Capteine there,
by the king, was appointed sir Henrie Fitz Hugh.</p>

were so forward to become the instrument of their
mischieuous wiues malice; the fulfilling wherof they would haue forborne, if with

<div class="sidenote">The principall offendors punishment.</div>

<p>The archbishop of Canturburie, when he had intelligence giuen of this outragious
prophanation of the church, caused the offendors to be excommunicat, as well at
Paules, as in all other parish churches of London. Shortlie after, to wit on the one
and twentith of Aprill, the said archbishop sat at saint Magnus, vpon inquisition for
the authors of the said disorder, and found the fault to consist speciallie in the lord
Strange and his wife.
So that vpon the first daie of Maie next following in Paules

submitted themselues to doo penance, and sware to doo it in such sort as to them

<div class="sidenote">Townes in Normandie y&eacute;elded to K. Henrie.</div>

<p>In the sixt yeare of king Henries reigne, he sent the earle of Warwike, and the
lord Talbot, to besiege the strong castell of Dampfront. The duke of Clarence was
also sent to besiege and subdue other townes, vnto whome, at one time and other,
we find, that these townes vnderwritten were y&eacute;elded, wherein he put capteins as
followeth.
In Courton Iohn Aubin, in Barney William Houghton, in Chambis Iames

Fangernon Iohn S. Albon, in Creuener sir Iohn Kirbie to whom it was giuen, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Anuilliers Robert Hornebie, in Bagles sir Iohn Arthur, in Fresnie le vicont sir Robert
Brent.</p>

<p>The duke of Glocester the same time, accompanied with the earle of March, the
lord Greie of Codner, and other was sent to subdue the townes in the Ile of Constantine,
vnto whome these townes hereafter mentioned were y&eacute;elded, where he appointed
capteins as followeth. At Carentine the lord Botreux, at Saint Lo Reginald West,
at Valoignes Thomas Burgh, at Pont Done Dauie Howell, at the Haie de Pais sir
Iohn Aston, at saint Sauieur le vicont sir Iohn Robsert, at Pontorson sir Robert
Gargraue, at Hamberie the earle of Suffolke lord of that place by gift, at Briqueuill
the said earle also by gift, at Auranches sir Philip Hall bailiffe of Alanson, at Vire the
lord Matreuers, at S. Iames de Beumeron the same lord.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chierburgh besieged by the English.</div>

<p>After that the duke had subdued to the kings dominion, the most part of all the
townes in that Ile of Constantine, Chierburgh excepted, he returned to the king, and
forthwith was sent thither againe to besiege that strong fortresse, which was fenced
with men, munition, vittels, and strong walles, towers, and turrets, in most defensible
wise, by reason whereof it was holden against him the space of fiue moneths, although
he vsed all waies and meanes possible to annoie them within, so that manie fierce
assaults, skirmishes, issues, and other exploits of warre were atchieued, betwixt the
Frenchmen within, and the Englishmen without: yet at length, the Frenchmen were
so constreined by power of baterie, mines, and other forceable waies of approchings,
that they were glad to compound to deliuer the place, if no rescue came to raise the
siege, either from the Dolphin, that then was retired into Aquitane, or from the duke
of Burgognie that then laie at Paris, within the terme of thr&eacute;e score and two daies
(for so long respit the duke granted) but they trusting further vpon his lenitie and
gentlenesse hoped to get a far longer terme.</p>

<p>Now were the Dolphin and the duke of Burgognie growen to a certeine agr&eacute;ement,
by mediation of cardinals sent from the pope, so that the Englishmen suerlie thought
that they would leauie a power, and come downe to rescue Chierburg. The duke of
Glocester therefore caused his camps to be stronglie intrenched, and manie defensible
blockehouses of timber to be raised, like to small turrets, that the same might be a
safegard to his people, and to conclude, left nothing vnfores&eacute;ene nor vndoone, that
was auailable for the defense of his armie. The king doubting least some power
should be sent downe, to the danger of his brother, and those that were with him at
this siege, caused two thousand men to be imbarked in thirtie ships of the west countrie,
by order sent vnto certeine lords there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chierburgh y&eacute;elded to the Englishmen.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The castell of Dampfront y&eacute;elded.</div>

<div class="sidenote">W. P.</div>

<p>The Frenchmen within the towne, perceiuing those succors to approch n&eacute;ere to the
towne, thought verelie that there had b&eacute;ene a power of Frenchmen comming to their
aid: but when they saw them receiued as fr&eacute;ends into the English campe, their comfort
was soone quailed; and so when the daie appointed came, being the ninet&eacute;enth of
October, or rather about the later end of Nouember (as the historic of the dukes of
Normandie hath) they rendred vp both the towne and castell, according to the couenants.
The lord Greie of Codnore was made the kings lieutenant there, and after his
deceasse, sir Walter Hungerford. About the same time, or rather before, as Titus Liuius
writeth, to wit, the two and twentith of Iune, the strong castell of Dampfront was
y&eacute;elded into the hands of the earle of Warwike, to the kings vse. But the historie
writen of the dukes of Normandie affirmeth, that it was surrendred the two and
twentith of September, after the siege had co&#x0304;tinued about it from Aprill last. The
king by honorable report of other, and of his owne speciall knowledge, so rightlie
ascerteined of the great valure that (for feats at armes and policie in warre) was alwaies
found in the person of that Iohn Bromley esquier (spoken of a little here before) for
which his maiestie so sundrie waies roiallie rewarded him againe; some specialtie yet
of the gentlemans merits togither with the souereignes bountie to him among other,
s&eacute;emes here (at mention of this Dampfront, whereof shortlie after he was capteine)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
verie well to deserue a place: and to that purpose as the king in Iulie went ouer
againe, and this Iohn Bromley in Iune the same yeare, with conduct of charge was
sent afore, imploieng himselfe still in venturous actiuitie with great annoie to the
enimie: his highnesse for good liking of the same, and for hartening and example to
other (in Aprill next following) gaue fourtie pounds land to him and his heires males

conquestum sexto.</p>

<p>The old armes of the house of Bromley being quarterlie gules and ore per fesse
indented, had in the seale to this d&eacute;ed, an inscutchen charged with a griffin surgiant;
his creast, out of a crowne, a demilion supporting a standard charged with a lion passant
gardant; about the shield was ingrauen, Sigillum Iohannis de Bromley militis.
That inscutchen and creast (as like is) giuen him in laudable remembrance for his
valiant recouerie of the standard at the sharpe and bloodie skirmish by Corbie. The
earle of Warwike, and the lord Talbot, after the winning of this fortresse, made sp&eacute;ed
to come vnto the siege of Rone, where they were imploied, as after shall appeare.
And in like manner, the duke of Glocester, hauing once got the possession of Chierburgh,
hasted towards the same siege: for the better furnishing of which enterprise,
he had first caused an armie of fift&eacute;ene thousand men to be brought ouer to him
vnder the leading of his vncle the duke of Excester, who imbarking with the same,
about the feast of the holie Trinitie, was appointed by the king to besiege the citie of
Eureux, as the earle of Angus, otherwise called earle of Kime, was sent to win the
castell of Millie Leuesche. These townes being deliuered to the kings vse, the duke
ordeined capteine of Eureux sir Gilbert Halsall knight.</p>

<p>The king now determining with all sp&eacute;ed to besiege Rone, prepared all things
necessarie for his purpose. Into this citie the Normans had conueied out of euerie
part their monie, iewels, and houshold stuffe, as into the most sure and strongest place
of the whole duchie. For since his arriuall, they had not onlie walled that citie,
and fortified it with rampiers and strong bulworks, but also furnished it with valiant
capteins, and hardie soldiers, to the number of foure thousand, beside such of the
citizens as were appointed for the warre, according to their estates, of the which
there were at the least fift&eacute;ene thousand readie to serue in defense of the citie, as
soldiers, and men of warre in all places where they should be assigned. King Henrie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
to haue the countrie fr&eacute;e, before he would besiege this citie, thought good first to win
such townes as laie in his waie, and therefore departing from Caen (where he had kept
the feast of saint George) the ninth daie of Iune, he marched streight vnto the towne
of Louiers, and laid his siege about the same.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Titus Liuius.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">Louiers besieged.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Louiers y&eacute;elded vp.</div>

<p>They within the towne, being well furnished of all things necessarie for the defending
of a siege, manfullie resisted the Englishmens inforcements, which spared not
to deuise all waies and means how to approch the walles, and to batter the same with
their great artillerie, till at length they brought the Frenchmen&#x0304; to that extremitie,
that they were contented to y&eacute;eld the towne on these conditions; that if by the thr&eacute;e
and twentith of Iune there came no succour from the French king to raise the siege,
the towne should be deliuered into the kings hands, the soldiers of the garrison should
serue vnder the king for a time, and the townesmen should remaine in their dwellings
as they did before, as subiects to the king: but the gunners that had discharged
anie p&eacute;ece against the Englishmen should suffer death.
When the daie came, and no
aid appeared, the couenants were performed accordinglie. From thence went the
king with all sp&eacute;ed vnto Point de Larch, standing vpon the riuer of Seine, eight
miles aboue Rone towards Paris: he came thither about the seauen and twentith
of Iune.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The English armie passeth the riuer of Seine.</div>

<p>When the Frenchmen which kept the passage there heard of the kings approach,
they gathered togither a great number of men of warre, minding to defend the passage
against him, appointing an other band of men (if they failed) to k&eacute;epe the further
side of the bridge; and to watch, that neither by boate nor vessell he should come ouer
the riuer by anie maner of meanes. At his comming n&eacute;ere to the towne, he perceiued
that it was not possible to passe by the bridge without great losse of his people,
and therfore he retired almost a mile backeward, where, in a pleasant and commodious
place by the riuer side he pitched his campe, and in the night season, what with
boates and barges, and what with hogsheads and pipes, he conueied ouer the broad
riuer of Seine a great companie of his soldiers, without anie resistance made by his
enimies.
For they which were on the hither side of Seine, thinking that the Englishmen
had gone to winne some other place, followed them not, but studied how to
defend their towne, which was inough for them to doo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A good policie.</div>

<p>And to put the French men in doubt, least the Englishmen should s&eacute;eke passage
somewhere else, the king appointed certeine of the soldiers which had skill in swimming,
to go to a place thr&eacute;e miles from the siege by the riuer side, and there to enter
into the water, making great clamor and noise, as though they had meant to haue
passed;
but they had in commandement not to trauerse past halfe the riuer, so to
procure the Frenchmen to make thitherwards, whilest the king in one place, and his
brother the duke of Clarence in another, got ouer their men, and that in such number,
before the Frenchmen had anie vnderstanding thereof, that when they made towards
them, and perceiued that they were not able to incounter them, they fled
backe, and durst not abide the English footmen, which would faine haue b&eacute;ene dooing
with them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pont de larch rendred vp to the Englishme&#x0304;.</div>

<p>When the king saw that his men were on the other side of the water, he (the next
daie earlie) returned to the towne, &amp; assaulted it on both sides. When the inhabitants
therefore saw themselues compassed on both sides, contrarie to their expectation, with
humble heart and small ioy they rendered vp the towne vnto the kings hands.
After
this, the king hauing no let nor impediment, determined foorthwith to besiege the
citie of Rone, and first sent before him his vncle the duke of Excester, with a great
companie of horssemen &amp; archers to view the place, &amp; thervpon with banner displaied
came before the citie, and sent Windsore an herauld at armes to the capteins
within, willing them to deliuer the citie vnto the king his maister, or else he would
pursue them with fire and sword. To whome they proudlie answered, that none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
they receiued of him, nor anie they would deliuer him, except by fine force they
were therevnto compelled: and herewith there issued out of the towne a great band
of men of armes, and incountered fiercelie with the Englishmen, the which receiuing
them with like manhood, and great force, draue the Frenchmen into the towne
againe to their losse, for they lett thirtie of their fellowes behind prisoners and dead
in the field.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rone besieged by K. Henrie.</div>

<p>The duke returned with this good sp&eacute;ed and proud answer of the Frenchmen vnto
the king, who remained yet at Pont de Larch, and had giuen the towne of Louiers
to his brother the duke of Clarence, which made there his deputie sir Iohn Godard
knight. After that the duke of Excester was returned to Pont Larch, the French
capteins within Rone set fire on the suburbs, beat downe churches, cut downe tr&eacute;es,
shred the bushes, destroied the vines round about the citie, to the intent that the
Englishmen should haue no rel&eacute;efe nor comfort either of lodging or fewell.
When
the king heard of these despitefull dooings, he with his whole armie remooued from
Pont Larch, and the last daie of Iulie came before the citie of Rone, and compassed
it round about with a strong siege. This citie was verie rich in gold, siluer, and
other pretious things, in so much that when the same was taken and seized vpon by the
English, the spoile was verie great and exc&eacute;eding aduantagable: which the compiler
of Anglorum pr&aelig;lia hath verie well noted, in a few lines, but pithie; saieng</p>

<p>The king laie with a great puissance at the Chartreux house, on the east side of
the citie, and the duke of Clarence lodged at S. Geruais before the port of Caux on the
west part.
The duke of Excester tooke his place on the north side: at port S. Denis,
betw&eacute;ene the dukes of Excester and Clarence, was appointed the earle marshall, euen
before the gate of the castell;
to whome were ioined the earle of Ormond, and the
lords Harington and Talbot, vpon his comming from Dampfront: and from the duke
of Excester toward the king were incamped the lords Ros, Willoughbie, Fits Hugh,
and sir William Porter, with a great band of northerne men, euen before the port of
saint Hilarie.
The earles of Mortaigne and Salisburie were assigned to lodge about
the abbie of saint Katharine. Sir Iohn Greie was lodged directlie against the chappell
called mount S. Michaell: sir Philip L&eacute;ech treasurer of the warres kept the hill next
the abbeie, and the baron of Carew kept the passage on the riuer of Seine, and to him
was ioined that valiant esquier Ienico Dartois.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Talbot.</div>

<p>On the further side of the riuer were lodged the earles of Warren and Huntington,

of warlike soldiers directlie before the gate called Port de Pont. And to the intent
that no aid should passe by the riuer toward the citie, there was a great chaine of iron
deuised at Pont Larch, set on piles from the one side of the water to the other:
and
beside that chaine, there was set vp a new forced bridge, sufficient both for cariage
and passage, to passe the riuer from one campe to another. The erle of Warwike
that had latelie woone Dampfront, was sent to besiege Cawdebecke, a towne standing
on the riuer side, betw&eacute;ene the sea and the citie of Rone.

<p>After this conflict, this towne was so hardlie handled with fierce and continuall
assaults, that the capteins within offered to suffer the English nauie to passe by
their towne without impeachment, vp to the citie of Rone. And also if Rone
y&eacute;elded, they promised to render the towne without delaie. H&eacute;erevpon the English
nauie, to the number of an hundred sailes, passed by Cawdebecke, and came to
Rone, and so besieged it on the water side. There came also to this siege the
duke of Glocester, with the earle of Suffolke, and the lord Aburgauennie, which
had taken (as before y&eacute;e haue heard) the towne of Chierburgh, &amp; lodged before
the port of S. Hilarie, n&eacute;erer to their enimies by fortie rodes than any other person
of the armie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king of Portingale sendeth aid to king Henrie.</div>

<p>During this siege also, there arriued at Harflue the lord of Kilmaine in Ireland,
a band of sixt&eacute;ene hundred Irishmen, in maile, with darts and skains after
the maner of their countrie, all of them being tall, quicke and nimble persons,
which came and presented themselues before the king lieng still at the siege, of
whom they were not onelie gentlie receiued &amp; welcomed; but also because it was
thought that the French king and the duke of Burgognie would shortlie come,
and either attempt to raise the siege, or vittell and man the towne by the north
gate, they were appointed to k&eacute;epe the north side of the armie, and speciallie
the waie that commeth from the forest of Lions.
Which charge the lord of Kilmaine
and his companie ioifullie accepted, and did so their deuoir therein, that no men
were more praised, nor did more damage to their enimies than they did: for suerlie
their quicknesse &amp; swiftnesse of foot did more preiudice to their enimies, than
their barded horsses did hurt or damage to the nimble Irishmen. Also the kings
coosine germane and alie (the king of Portingale) sent a great nauie of well appointed
ships vnto the mouth of the riuer of Seine, to stop that no French vessels should
enter the riuer, and passe vp the same, to the aid of them within Rone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The number within Rone.</div>

<p>Thus was the faire citie of Rone compassed about with enimies, both by water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
and land, hauing neither comfort nor aid of King, Dolphin, or Duke. And yet
although the armie was strong without, there lacked not within both hardie capteins
and manfull souldiers. And as for people, they had more than inough: for as it
is written by some that had good cause to know the truth, and no occasion to
erre from the same, there were in the citie at the time of the siege, two hundred
and ten thousand persons. Dailie were issues made out of the citie at diuerse
gates, sometime to the losse of the one partie, and sometime of the other, as chances
of warre in such aduentures happen. The Frenchmen in d&eacute;ed preferring fame before
worldlie riches, and despising pleasure (the enimie to warlike prowesse) sware
ech to other neuer to render or deliuer the citie, while they might either hold
sword in hand or speare in rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Titus Liuius.</i></div>

<p>The king of England aduertised of their haultie courages, determined to conquer
them by famine, which would not be tamed with weapon. Wherefore he stopped
all the passages, both by water and land, that no vittels could be conueied to
the citie: he cast trenches round about the wals, and set them full of stakes, and
defended with archers, so that there was left neither waie for them within to
issue out, nor for anie that were abroad to enter in without his licence. To rehearse
the great paines, trauell and diligence, which the king tooke vpon him in his
owne person at this siege, a man might woonder. And because diuerse of the
souldiers had lodged themselues for their more ease, in places so farre distant one
from an other, that they might easilie haue b&eacute;ene surprised by their enimies, yer
anie of their fellowes could haue come to their succors; he caused proclamation
to be made, that no man vpon paine of death should lodge without the precinct
appointed them, nor go further abroad from the campe than such bounds as were
assigned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">King Henrie his iustice.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Thom. Wals.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">Thr&eacute;e great victories on the English side within a short time togither.</div>

<p>Now as it chanced, the king in going about the campe, to surueie and view the
warders, he espied two souldiers that were walking abroad without the limits assigned,
whom he caused straightwaies to be apprehended and hanged vpon a tr&eacute;e of
great height, for a terrour to others, that none should be so hardie to breake such
orders as he commanded them to obserue. Whilest the king laie thus with his power
about the mightie citie of Rone, the Frenchmen sought to indamage as well those
that were at that siege, as other of the Englishmen that laie in garrisons within the
townes that were alreadie in the king of Englands possession, insomuch that (as
some haue written) within the octaues of the Assumption, thr&eacute;e notable victories
chanced to the Englishmen in thr&eacute;e seuerall places. First an hundred Englishmen
at Kilbeuf tooke thr&eacute;e great lords of the Frenchmen, besides fourescore other persons,
and put thr&eacute;e hundred to flight.</p>

<p>Also vpon the thursdaie within the same octaues, foure hundred Frenchmen that
were entered within the suburbes of Eureux were repelled by eleuen Englishmen,
that tooke foure of those Frenchmen prisoners, slue twelue of them, and tooke fortie
horsses. On the saturdaie following, the Frenchmen tooke in hand to steale vpon
them that laie in garrison within Louiers, in hope to surprise the towne earlie in the
morning: but the capteine perceiuing their purpose, sallied foorth with a hundred
of his men, and putting the Frenchmen to flight, being a thousand, tooke an
hundred and fourescore of them being all gentlemen. But to returne to them before
Rone. The siege thus continuing from Lammas, almost to Christmas, diuerse
enterprises were attempted, and diuerse policies practised, how euerie part might indamage
his aduersaries; no parte greatlie reioised of their gaine. But in the meane
time vittels began sore to faile them within, that onelie vinegar and water serued
for drinke.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extreme famine within Rone.</div>

<p>If I should rehearse (according to the report of diuerse writers) how d&eacute;erelie dogs,
rats, mise, and cats were sold within the towne, and how gr&eacute;edilie they were by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
poore people eaten and deuoured, and how the people dailie died for fault of food,
and yoong infants laie sucking in the str&eacute;ets on their moothers breasts lieng dead,
starued for hunger; the reader might lament their extreme miseries. A great number
of poore sillie creaturs were put out at the gates, which were by the Englishmen
that kept the trenches beaten and driuen backe againe to the same gates, which
they found closed and shut against them. And so they laie betw&eacute;ene the wals of
the citie and the trenches of the enimies, still crieng for helpe and rel&eacute;efe, for lacke
whereof great numbers of them dailie died.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A vertuous and Charitable prince.</div>

<p>Howbeit, king Henrie mooued with pitie, vpon Christmasse daie, in the honor of
Christes Natiuitie, refreshed all the poore people with vittels, to their great comfort
and his high praise: yet if the duke of Burgognies letters had not b&eacute;ene conueied
into the citie, it was thought they within would neuer haue made resistance so
long time as they did; for by those letters they were assured of rescue to come.
Diuerse lords of France hauing written to them to the like effect, they were put in
such comfort herewith, that immediatlie, to expresse their great reioising, all the
bels in the citie were roong foorth ch&eacute;erefullie, which during all the time of the
siege till that present had kept silence. In d&eacute;ed by reason of a faint kind of agr&eacute;ement
procured betwixt the Dolphin and the duke of Burgognie, it was thought
verelie that a power should haue b&eacute;ene raised for preseruation of that noble citie, the
loosing or sauing thereof being a matter of such importance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Chron. S. Alb.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">A large tre&#x0304;ch without the campe.</div>

<p>The king of England, to preuent the enimies purpose, caused a large trench to be,
cast without his campe, which was pight full of sharpe stakes, with a great rampire
fensed with bulworks, and turnepikes, in as defensible wise as might be deuised.
Sir Robert Bapthorpe, knight, was appointed comptroller, to s&eacute;e this worke performed,
which he did with all diligence accomplish; in like case as he had doone, when the
other trench and rampire stronglie staked and hedged was made at the first betwixt
the campe and the citie, to restreine such as in the begining of the siege rested
not to pricke foorth of the gates on horsse backe. And so by this meanes was
the armie defended both behind and before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1419</div>

<p>Finallie, the whole number of the Frenchmen within the citie were brought to such an
extremitie for want of vittels, that they were in danger all to haue starued. Wherevpon
being now past hope of rel&eacute;efe, they determined to treat with the king of England,
and so vpon Newyeares euen there came to the wals such as they had chosen
amongst them for commissioners, which made a signe to the Englishmen lieng without
the gate of the bridge, to speake with some gentleman, or other person of authoritie.
The earle of Huntington, which kept that part, sent to them sir Gilbert
Umfreuile; vnto whom they declared, that if they might haue a safe conduct, they
would gladlie come foorth to speake with the king. Sir Gilbert reparing to the duke
of Clarence, and other of the kings councell, aduertised them of this request.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They within Rone demand parl&eacute;e.</div>

<p>Herevpon the duke of Clarence with the other councellors resorted to the kings
lodging, to informe him of the matter, and to know his pleasure therein; who after
good aduisement and deliberation taken, willed sir Gilbert to aduertise them, that he
was content to heare twelue of them, which should be safelie conueied into his presence.
This answer being brought to the Frenchmen by the said sir Gilbert, on the
next daie in the morning, foure knights, foure learned men, and foure sage burgesses,
all clothed in blacke, came foorth of the citie, and were receiued at the port saint
Hilarie by sir Gilbert Umfreuile, accompanied with diuerse gentlemen and yeomen
of the kings houshold, commonlie called yeomen of the crowne, by whome they
were conueied to the kings lodging, whome they found at masse, which being ended,
the king came out of his trauerse, sternelie, and princelie beholding the French
messengers, and passed by them into his chamber. And incontinentlie after he
commanded that they should be brought in before his presence, to heare what they
had to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A presumptuous orator.</div>

<p>One of them s&eacute;ene in the ciuill lawes, was appointed to declare the message in all
their names, who shewing himselfe more rash than wise, more arrogant than learned,
first tooke vpon him to shew wherin the glorie of victorie consisted, aduising the
king not to shew his manhood in famishing a multitude of poore, simple, and innocent
people, but rather suffer such miserable wretches as laie betwixt the wals of the
citie, and the trenches of his siege, to passe through the campe, that they might get
their liuing in other places, and then if he durst manfullie assault the citie, and by
force subdue it, he should win both worldlie fame and merit great m&eacute;ed at the hands
of almightie God, for hauing compassion of the poore, n&eacute;edie, and indigent people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The kings answer to this proud message.</div>

<p>When this orator had said, the king who no request lesse suspected, than that
which was thus desired, began a while to muse; and after he had well considered the
craftie cautell of his enimies, with a fierce countenance, and bold spirit he reprooued
them, both for their subtill dealing with him, and their malapert presumption, in that
they should s&eacute;eme to go about to teach him what belonged to the dutie of a conquerour.
"And therefore since it appeared that the same was vnknowne vnto them, he
declared that the goddesse of battell called Bellona, had thr&eacute;e handmaidens, euer of
necessitie attending vpon hir, as blood, fire, and famine. And whereas it laie in his
choise to vse them all thr&eacute;e; yea, two, or one of them at his pleasure, he had appointed
onelie the m&eacute;ekest maid of those thr&eacute;e damsels to punish them of that citie,
till they were brought to reason.</p>

<p>"And whereas the gaine of a capteine atteined by anie of the said thr&eacute;e handmaidens,
was both glorious, honourable, and woorthie of triumph: yet of all the thr&eacute;e, the
yoongest maid, which he meant to vse at that time was most profitable and commodious.
And as for the poore people lieng in the ditches, if they died through famine,
the fault was theirs, that like cruell tyrants had put them out of the towne,
to the intent he should slaie them; and yet had he saued their liues, so that if anie
lacke of charitie was, it rested in them, and not in him. But to their cloked request,
he meant not to gratifie them within so much, but they should k&eacute;epe them still to
helpe to spend their vittels. And as to assault the towne, he told them that he
would they should know, he was both able and willing thereto, as he should s&eacute;e occasion:
but the choise was in his hand, to tame them either with blood, fire, or
famine, or with them all, whereof he would take the choice at his pleasure, and not
at theirs."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A truce for eight daies.</div>

<p>This answer put the French ambassadors in a great studie, musing much at his
excellent wit and hawtinesse of courage. Now after they had dined (as his commandement
was they should) with his officers, they vpon consultation had togither,
required once againe to haue accesse to his roiall presence, which being granted, they
humbling themselues on their kn&eacute;es, besought him to take a truce for eight daies,
during the which they might by their commissioners take some end and good conclusion
with him and his councell. The king like a mercifull prince granted to them
their asking, with which answer they ioifullie returned. After their departure were
appointed and set vp thr&eacute;e tents, the one for the lords of England, the second for
the commissioners of the citie, and the third for both parties to assemble in, and to
treat of the matter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Co&#x0304;missioners appointed.</div>

<p>The commissioners for the English part were the earles of Warwike and Salisburie,
the lord Fitz Hugh, sir Walter Hungerford, sir Gilbert Umfreuile, sir Iohn Robsert,
and Iohn de Vasques de Almada. And for the French part were appointed, sir
Guie de Butteler, and six others. These commissioners met euery daie, arguing and
reasoning about a conclusion, but nothing was doone the space of eight daies nor
so much as one article concluded: wherfore the Englishmen tooke downe the tents,
&amp; the Frenchmen tooke their leaue: but at their departing they remembering them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>selues,
required the English lords (for the loue of God) that the truce might indure
till the sunne rising the next daie, to the which the lords assented.</p>

<p>When the French commissioners were returned into the citie without any conclusion
of agr&eacute;ement, the poore people ran about the str&eacute;ets, crieng, and calling the
capteins and gouernors murtherers and manquellers, saieng that for their pride and
stiffe stomachs all this miserie was happened, threatning to flea them if they would not
agr&eacute;e vnto the king of Englands demand. The magistrats herewith amazed, called
all the townesmen togither to know their minds and opinions. The whole voice of
the commons was, to y&eacute;eld rather than to sterue. Then the Frenchmen in the
euening came to the tent of sir Iohn Robsert, requiring him of gentlenes to mooue
the king, that the truce might be prolonged for foure daies. The king therevnto
agr&eacute;ed, and appointed the archbishop of Canturburie, and the other seuen before
named for his part, and the citizens appointed a like number for them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The articles co&#x0304;cerning the y&eacute;elding vp of Rone.</div>

<p>The tents were againe set vp, and dailie they met togither, and on the fourth daie
they accorded on this wise, that the citie and castell of Rone should be deliuered
vnto the king of England, at what time after the middest of the ninet&eacute;enth daie of
that present moneth of Ianuarie, the said king willed the same; and that all the
capteins and other men whatsoeuer, dwelling or being within the said citie and castell,
should submit them in all things to the grace of the said king: and further, that
they should paie to the said king thr&eacute;e hundred thousand scutes of gold, whereof
alwaies two should be woorth an English noble, or in stead of euerie scute thirtie
great blankes white, or fift&eacute;ene grotes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Luca Italico</div>

<p>Moreouer it was accorded, that euerie soldier and stranger, being in the said
citie and castell, should sweare on the euangelists before their departure, not to
beare armour against the king of England before the first daie of Ianuarie next to come.
Also they within the towne should suffer all the poore people lieng in ditches, or
about the ditches of the citie, which for penurie were chased out, to enter the citie
againe, and to find them sufficient food till the said ninet&eacute;enth daie of Ianuarie.
There were diuerse other articles, in all to the number of two and twentie agr&eacute;ed as
well on the behalfe of the citizens, as of king Henrie, who granted, that all the souldiers,
strangers, and other within the said citie and castell at that time, being not
willing to become his lieges, should depart, after that the citie and castell was once
y&eacute;elded, fr&eacute;elie without let, leauing to the said king all their armors, horsses, harnesse,
and goods, except the Normans, which if they should refuse to become lieges
to him, were appointed to remaine as his prisoners, togither with one Luca Italico, and
certeine others.</p>

<p>When the daie of appointment came, which was the daie of saint Wolstane, sir
Guie de Buttler, and the burgesses, deliuered the keies of the citie and castell vnto
the king of England, bes&eacute;eching him of fauour and compassion. The king incontinentlie
appointed the duke of Excester, with a great companie to take possession
of the citie, who like a valiant capteine mounted on a goodlie courser first entered
into the citie, and after into the castell. The next daie being fridaie, the king in
great triumph, like a conquerour, accompanied with foure dukes, ten earles, eight
bishops, sixt&eacute;ene barons, and a great multitude of knights, esquiers, and men of
warre entered into Rone, where he was receiued by the cleargie, with two and fourtie
crosses; and then met him the senat, and the burgesses of the towne, offering to him
diuerse faire and costlie presents.</p>

<p>In this manner he passed through the citie to our ladie church, and there hauing
said his orisons, he caused his chapleins to sing this antheme: Quis est tam magnus
dominus: Who is so great a lord as our God. This doone, he came to the
castell, where he continued a good space after, receiuing homages and fealties of
the burgesses and townesmen, and setting orders amongst them. He also r&eacute;edified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
diuerse fortresses, and townes, during which time he made proclamation, that all men
which would become his subiects, should enioy their goods, lands &amp; offices, which proclamation
made manie townes to y&eacute;eld, and manie men to become English the same
season.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A league concluded betw&eacute;ene king Henrie and the duke of Britaine.</div>

<p>The duke of Britaine, vnderstanding that if the king of England should continue
in possession of Normandie, his countrie could not but be in great danger, if he
prouided not to haue him his fr&eacute;end, vpon safe conduct obteined for him &amp; his retinue,
came to Rone with fiue hundred horsses, and being honorablie receiued of the king,
after conference had betwixt them of diuerse things, at length they agr&eacute;ed vpon a
league on this wise, that neither of them should make warre vnto the other, nor to
any the others people or subiects, except he that meant to make war denounced
the same six moneths before. Thus this league being concluded, the duke tooke leaue
of the king and so returned into Britaine.</p>

<p>About the same time, at the sute of certeine bishops and abbats of Nomandie, the
king confirmed vnto them their ancient priuileges, granted by the former dukes of
Normandie and kings of France, except such as were granted by those whome he
reputed for vsurpers, and no lawfull kings or dukes. He also established at Caen
the chamber of accounts of the reuenues of his dukedome of Normandie. In Rone
he begun the foundation of a strong tower behind the castell, that from the castell
to the tower, and from the tower to his palace, the men of warre appointed there in
garrison, might passe in suertie without danger of the citie, if perhaps the citizens
should attempt any rebellion.</p>

the duke of Bedford the kings lieutenant in his absence, and by him committed to
safe k&eacute;eping in the castell of L&eacute;eds in Kent, there to abide the kings pleasure. About
the same time, one frier Randoll of the order of Franciscanes that professed diuinitie,
and had b&eacute;ene confessor to the same qu&eacute;ene, was taken in the Ile of Gernesey; and
being first brought ouer into Normandie, was by the kings commandement sent hither
into England, and committed to the Tower, where he remained till the parson of the

<p>Whilest the king remained in Rone, to set things in order for the establishment of
good policie in that citie, he sent abroad diuerse of his capteins, with conuenient
forces to subdue certeine townes &amp; castels in those parties, as his brother the duke of
Clarence, who wan the strong towne of Vernon and Mante. In Vernon was sir William
Porter made capteine, and in Mant the earle of March. The earle of Salisburie
wan Hunflue, after he had besieged it from the fourth of Februarie vntill the twelfth
of March. This towne was giuen afterwards vnto the duke of Clarence. Also the
said earle of Salisburie wan the townes of Monster de Villiers, Ew, Newcastell, and
finallie all the places in that quarter, which till that present were not vnder the English
obeisance. At Newcastell sir Philip L&eacute;ech was made capteine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Roch Guion rendered vp.</div>

<p>After Candlemasse, the king departed from Rone to go to Eureux, whither he promised
to come in like case, as the Dolphin promised to be at Dreux, to the end that
they might aduise vpon a conuenient place where to m&eacute;et, to intreat of peace to be
concluded betwixt the two realms. But the Dolphin by sinister persuasion of some
enimies to concord, brake promise, and came not. When the king saw that thorough
default of his aduersarie, no treatie would be had, he remooued to Vernon,
and there a while remained. Now from Eureux the king had dispatched the earle of
Warwike vnto the siege of la Roch Guion, which fortresse he so constreined, that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
was y&eacute;elded into his hands, the sixt of Aprill, in the beginning of this seuenth

<div class="sidenote">Chateau Galiard besieged.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Yuri taken by assault.</div>

<p>About the same time, the duke of Excester laid siege vnto Chateau Galiard,
which siege continued from the last of March, vnto the latter end of September,
or (as some write) vnto the twentith of December, as after shall appeare. The
duke of Glocester being sent to win the towne and castell of Yuri, tooke the
towne by assault, and the castell was deliuered by composition after fortie daies
siege. After this the Englishmen ouerran the countrie about Chartres, and did
much hurt to their enimies in all places where they came. The hearts of the
Frenchmen were sore discouraged with the losse of Rone, and the other townes
which y&eacute;elded one after another thus to the Englishmen, so that such as loued
the wealth of their countrie sore lamented the imminent misch&eacute;efes, which they
saw by the diuision of the nobilitie, like shortlie to fall on their heads, namelie
bicause they saw no remidie prepared.</p>

<p>But who euer else was disquieted with this matter, Iohn duke of Burgognie raged
and swelled, yea and so much freated therewith, that he wist not what to saie, and
lesse to doo: for he knew well that he was neither fr&eacute;e from disdaine, nor yet deliuered
from the scope of malice, bicause that he onelie ruled the king, and had the
whole dooings in all matters about him. And therefore he considered, that all such
mishaps as chanced to the state of the common-wealth would be imputed to his
negligence and disordred gouernement. To find some remedie against such dangers
at hand, he thought first to assaie, if he might by any reasonable means conclude a
peace betwixt the two mightie kings of England and France, which if he might
bring to passe, he doubted not to reuenge his quarell easilie inough against the Dolphin
Charles, and to represse all causes of grudge and disdaine.</p>

not but by his onelie meanes, peace should be brought in place, and bloudie battell
cl&eacute;erelie exiled. King Henrie giuing courteous eare to these ambassadors, sent with
them the earle of Warwike as his ambassador, accompanied with two hundred gentlemen
to talke with the duke, as then remaining in the French court at the towne of
Prouince. The earle was assailed by the waie as he iournied, by a great number of
rebellious persons, gotten into armour of purpose to haue spoiled him of such monie
and things as he and his companie had about them. But by the high valiancie of the
English people, with the aid of their bowes, the Frenchmen were discomfited and
chased.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Creation of earles.</div>

<p>The earle at his comming to Prouince was honorablie receiued, and hauing doone
the effect of his message, returned; and with him the earle of saint Paule, and the
sonne and heire of the duke of Burbon were also sent as ambassadors from the French
king, to conclude vpon the time and place of the m&eacute;eting, with all the circumstances.
Wherevpon the king of England agr&eacute;ed to come to the towne of Mante, with condition
that the duke of Burgognie, and other for the French king should come to
Pontoise, that either part might m&eacute;et other in a conuenient place betwixt those two
townes n&eacute;ere to Meulan. According to this appointment, K. Henrie came to Mante,
where in the feast of Pentecost he kept a liberall house to all commers, and sate himselfe
in great estate. Vpon the which daie, either for good seruice alreadie by them
doone, or for the good expectation of things to come, he created Gascoigne de Fois,
otherwise called the captau or captall de Buef a valiant Gascoigne, earle of Longueuile;
and sir Iohn Greie earle of Tankeruile, and the lord Bourchier, earle of Ew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Either part was appointed to bring with them not past two thousand and fiue hundred men of warre as <i>Tit. Liu.</i> saith.</div>

<p>After this solemne feast ended, the place of enteruiew and m&eacute;eting was appointed
to be beside Meulan on the riuer of Seine, where in a faire place euerie part was by
commissioners appointed to their ground. When the daie of appointment approched,
which was the last daie of Maie, the king of England accompanied with the dukes
of Clarence, and Glocester, his brethren, the duke of Excester his vncle, and Henrie
Beauford clerke his other vncle, which after was bishop of Winchester and cardinall,
with the earles of March, Salisburie, and others, to the number of a thousand men of
warre, entered into his ground, which was barred about and ported, wherin his tents
were pight in a princelie maner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A treatie of peace.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Titus Liuius.</i></div>

<p>Likewise for the French part came Isabell the French qu&eacute;ene, bicause hir husband
was fallen into his old frantike disease, hauing in hir companie the duke of Burgognie,
and the earle of saint Paule, and she had attending vpon hir the faire ladie Katharine
hir daughter, with six and twentie ladies and damosels; and had also for hir furniture
a thousand men of warre. The said ladie Katharine was brought by hir mother
onelie to the intent that the king of England beholding hir excellent beautie, should
be so inflamed and rapt in hir loue, that he to obteine hir to his wife, should the sooner
agr&eacute;e to a gentle peace and louing concord.
But though manie words were spent in this treatie, and that they met at eight seuerall times, yet no effect insued, nor any
conclusion was taken by this fr&eacute;endlie consultation, so that both parties after a princelie
fashion tooke leaue ech of other, and departed; the Englishmen to Mante, and
the Frenchmen to Pontoise.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Chro. of Flanders.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Titus Liuius.</i></div>

<p>Some authors write that the Dolphin to staie that no agr&eacute;ement should passe, sent
sir Taneguie de Chastell to the duke of Burgognie, declaring that if he would breake
off the treatie with the Englishmen, he would then common with him; and take
such order, that not onelie they but the whole realme of France should thereof be
glad and reioise. Howsoeuer it came to passe, truth it is that where it was agr&eacute;ed,
that they should eftsoones haue met in the same place on the third of Iulie; the king
according to that appointment came: but there was none for the French part, neither
qu&eacute;ene nor duke that once appeared; so that it was manifest inough how the
fault rested not in the Englishmen, but in the Frenchmen. By reason wherof no
conclusion sorted to effect of all this communication, saue onlie that a certeine
sparke of burning loue was kindled in the kings heart by the sight of the ladie
Katharine.</p>

<p>The king without doubt was highlie displeased in his mind, that this communication
came to no better passe. Wherefore he mistrusting that the duke of Burgognie was
the verie let and stop of his desires, said vnto him before his departure: "Coosine, we
will haue your kings daughter, and all things that we demand with hir, or we will
driue your king and you out of his realme. Well (said the duke of Burgognie) before
you driue the king and me out of his realme, you shall be well wearied, and thereof
we doubt little." Shortlie after, the duke of Burgognie and the Dolphin met in the
plaine fields besides Melun, and there comming togither, concluded apparantlie an
open peace and amitie, which was proclamed in Paris, Amiens, and Pontoise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A conspiracie in Rone.</div>

<p>This agr&eacute;ement was made the sixt of Iulie in the yeare 1419. It was ingrossed by
notaries, signed with their hands, and sealed with their great seales of armes: but
as the sequele shewed, hart thought not what toong spake, nor mind meant not that
hand wrote.
Whiles these things were a dooing, diuerse of the Frenchmen in Rone
went about a conspiracie against the Englishmen, whereof the king being well aduertised,
sent thither certeine of his nobles, which tried out these conspirators, caused
them to be apprehended, had them in examination, and such as they found guiltie
were put to death; and so setting the citie in quietnes, returned to the king, who counted
it great honor to k&eacute;epe the countries which he woone by conquest in obedience and
aw; sith such victories are not obteined without sore labour and toile, both of prince

<div class="sidenote"><i>Hist. des ducs de Normand</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The king plaieth the porters part.</div>

<p>The king of England, perceiuing, by this new aliance, that nothing was lesse to
be looked for, than peace at the hands of the Frenchmen, deuised still how to win
townes and fortresses, which were kept against him: and now that the truce was
expired, on the thirtith daie of Iulie, he being as then within the towne of Mante,
appointed certeine bands of souldiers in the after noone to passe out of the gates,
giuing onelie knowledge to the capteins what he would haue them to doo. And to
the intent that no inkling of the enterprise should come to the enimies eare, he kept
the gates himselfe as porter. These that were thus sent foorth being guided by the
earle of Longueuile, otherwise called the captau de Buef, were commanded in secret
maner as they could to draw toward the towne of Pontoise, and to k&eacute;epe themselues
in couert till the darke of the night, and then approch the walles of that towne, and
vpon espieng their aduantage to enter it by scaling, hauing ladders and all things
necessarie with them for the purpose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This captau was brother to the earle of Fois.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Hall.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">Pontoise surprised by the Englishmen.</div>

<p>Moreouer, about the closing of the daie and night in the euening, he sent foorth
the erle of Huntington with other bands of soldiers, to succor and assist the other,
if they chanced to enter the towne according to the order taken. Those that were
first sent foorth (according to their instructions) conueid themselues so closelie to their
appointed places, that the enimies heard nothing of their dooings. Wherevpon when
the night was come, they came in secret wise vnder the walles, and there watched
their time till the morning began to draw on. In the meane time, whilest the watch
was departed, and before other were come into their places to relieue it, the Englishmen
setting vp their ladders, entered and brake open one of the gates to receiue the
other that followed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Hall.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Hall.</i></div>

<p>The Frenchmen perceiuing that the walles were taken, and their enimies entered
into the towne, at the first were sore amazed: but after perceiuing the small number
of the Englishmen, they assembled togither and fiercelie assailed them, so that they
were constreined to retire to the walles and turrets which they had taken, and with
much adoo defended the same; some leaping downe into the diches, and hiding them
in the vines, till at length the earle of Huntington, with his companies came to their
succors, and entring by the gate which was open, easilie did beat backe the enimies,
&amp; got the market place. Which when the lord Lisle Adam capteine of the towne
perceiued, he opened the gate towards Paris, by the which he with all his retinue,
and diuerse of the townesmen to the number of ten thousand in all, (as Enguerant de
Monstr. recounteth) fled towards Paris, taking awaie with them their coine, iewels,
and plate. Some of them fl&eacute;eing towards Beauuois were met with, and stripped of
that they had, by Iehan de Guigni, and Iehan de Claw, two capteins that serued the
Orlientiall faction.</p>

<p>There were within the towne of Pontoise at that time when it was thus taken by
the Englishmen, a thousand lances, and two thousand arcubalisters, as Thomas Wilsingham
affirmeth, and of Englishmen and Gascoignes that went first foorth of Mante
with the captau de Buef, not past fift&eacute;ene hundred, as Hall reporteth: although
Enguerant de Monstrellet saith, they were about thr&eacute;e thousand. But how manie
soeuer they were, they durst not at the first, by reason of their small number (as may
be thought) once diuide themselues, or deale with booties, till about the houre of
prime, that the duke of Clarence came to their aid with fiue thousand men, who
much praising the valiantnesse of the earle and his retinue that had thus woone the
towne, gaue to them the ch&eacute;efe spoile of the which there was great plentie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">The duke of Clarence co&#x0304;meth before Paris with his armie.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Irishme&#x0304; spoil the Ile of France.</div>

<p>Then went the duke foorth towards Paris, and comming thither, lodged before it
two daies and two nights, without perceiuing anie proffer or issue to be made foorth
against him by his enimies, and therefore s&eacute;eing they durst not once looke vpon him,
he returned to Pontoise, for the taking of which towne the whole countrie of France,
and speciallie the Parisians were sore dismaied: sith now there was no fortresse able to
withstand the English puissance; for that the Irishmen ouerran all the Isle of France,
did to the Frenchmen damages innumerable, (as their writers affirme) brought dailie
preies to the English armie, burst vp houses, laid beds on the backes of the kine, rid
vpon them, carried yoong children before them, and sold them to the Englishmen for
slaues. These strange dooings so feared the Frenchmen within the territorie of Paris,
and the countrie about, that the sorie people fled out of the villages with all their
stuffe into the citie.</p>

<p>The French king, and the duke of Burgognie lieng at saint Denis, in this season,
departed from thence with the qu&eacute;ene and hir daughter, and went to Trois in Champaigne,
there to consult of their businesse, hauing left at Paris the earle of S. Paule,
and the lord Lisle Adam, with a great puissance to defend the citie. The king of England
immediatlie after that Pontoise was woone (as before y&eacute;e haue heard) came thither
in person, as well to giue order for the placing of a sufficient garrison there for defense
thereof; as to proc&eacute;ed further into the countrie for the getting of other townes and places:
and so after he had well prouided for the good gouernment, &amp; safe k&eacute;eping thereof, the
eight&eacute;enth daie of August he departed out of the same with his maine armie.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Titus Liuius.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The castell of Vaucon Villers besieged and taken.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Titus Liuius.</i></div>

<p>And bicause they of the garrison that laie in the castell of Vaucon Villers had
doone, and dailie did diuerse and sundrie displeasures to the Englishmen, he pight
downe his field n&eacute;ere to the same, the better to restraine them from their hostile
attempts, and withall sent part of his armie to besiege the castell, which put them in
such feare, that they despairing of all rel&eacute;efe or succour, and perceiuing they should not
be able long to defend the place against the kings puissance, y&eacute;elded the place, with all
their coine and other goods into the kings hands. The soldiers of that garrison, and
the inhabitants, at the contemplation of a certeine ladie there amongst them, were
licenced by the king to depart without armor or weapon, onelie with their liues saued.
Iohn of Burgh that was after bailiffe of Gisours, was appointed capteine of this
castell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gisours besieged and y&eacute;elded to the Englishmen.</div>

<p>After this, all the townes and castels within a great circuit offered to y&eacute;eld themselues
vnto the English obeisance; the strong towne and castell of Gisours onelie
excepted, which still held out, &amp; would shew no token of will to y&eacute;eld. H&eacute;erevpon
the king the last of August began to approch the same, but at the first he could
not come n&eacute;ere, by reason of the marishes and fennes: but yet such was the diligence
of the Englishmen, aduanced by the presence of the king, readie in all places
to commend them that were forward in their businesse, and to chastise such as
slacked their duetie, that dailie they came n&eacute;erer and n&eacute;erer, although the Frenchmen
issued foorth dailie to encounter them, giuing them manie sharpe skirmishes.
For the towne being double walled and fensed with those broad marishes, so incouraged
them within, that they thought no force had b&eacute;ene able to haue subdued
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Thom. Wals.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">Duke of Clarence saith <i>Rich. Grafton.</i></div>

<p>But at length calling to remembrance, that the king of England came before no
towne nor fortresse, from which he would depart before he had brought it vnder
his subiection, they offered to come to a parl&eacute;e, and in the end compounded to
render the towne into the kings hands the eight daie of September next insuing,
and the castell (bicause it was the stronger p&eacute;ece) they couenanted to deliuer the
foure and twentith of the same, if in the meane time no rescue came to raise the
siege. Herevpon when no such rel&eacute;efe could be heard of, at the daies limited, the
soldiers of the garrison, and the more part of the townsmen also submitted themselues,
and receiued an oth to be true subiects to the king, and so remained still in
their roomes. The earle of Worcester was made capteine there.</p>

<p>About the same time, to wit, the thr&eacute;e and twentith of September (as some write)
was castell Galiard surrendred to the hands of the duke of Excester, which had b&eacute;ene
besieged euer since the last daie of March (as before y&eacute;e haue heard.) But others
write that it held out seauen moneths, and was not deliuered vp till the twentith
of December. This castell was not onelie strong by situation, standing vpon the top
of a st&eacute;epe hill, but also closed with mightie thicke walles, and furnished with men
and all maner of munition and things necessarie. The king appointed the lord Ros
capteine of it. After that Gisours and castell Galeard were thus y&eacute;elded to the English
obeisance, all the other townes and castels thereabout, and in the countrie of
Veulquessin, shortlie after y&eacute;elded to the king, as Gourneie, Chauniount, Neaufle,
Dangu, and other small fortresses. Of Gourneie, was sir Gilbert Umfreuile made capteine;
at Neaufle, the earle of Worcester; and at Dangu, Richard Wooduile. Shortlie
after was the castell Daumall y&eacute;elded to the earle of Warwike, to whome it was giuen.
And thus was the whole duchie of Normandie (Mont saint Michael onelie excepted)
reduced to the possession of the right heire, which had b&eacute;ene wrongfullie deteined from
the kings of England euer since the daies of king Iohn, who lost it about the yeare
one thousand two hundred and seauen.</p>

<p>To satisfie those that be desirous to know what capteins were appointed by the
king in diuerse townes that were y&eacute;elded to him (of which we haue made no mention
heretofore but in generall) here their names doo follow, and of the townes, as
we find them in the chronicles of maister Hall. At Crewleie sir Henrie Tanclux an
Almaine; at Torignie, sir Iohn Popham, to whome it was giuen; at Chamboie, the
lord Fitz Hugh; at Vernueil in Perch, sir Iohn Neuill; at Essaie, sir William

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Burgognie murthered.</div>

<p>But now to returne where we left. The wise and graue personages of the realme
of France, sore lamenting &amp; bewailing the miserie of their countrie, saw they had
puissance inough to defend their enimies, if they were of perfect concord amongst
themselues. And therefore to remooue all rancor and displeasure betwixt the Dolphin,
and the duke of Burgognie, they procured a new m&eacute;eting, which was appointed
to be at Monstreau ou fault Yonne, where the two princes at the daie assigned
met. But such was the fortune of France, that the duke of Burgognie was there
murthered, as he kn&eacute;eled before the Dolphin: wherevpon insued greater debate
than before. For Philip earle of Charolois, the sonne and heire of the said duke,
tooke the matter verie gr&eacute;euouslie, as he had no lesse cause, and determined to
be reuenged on the Dolphin, and other that were guiltie of the murther: so that
now there was great expectation of slaughter and bloudshed, but no hope for the
most part of tranquillitie &amp; peace. France therefore, what with ouerthrowes giuen
by the English, &amp; diuision among themselues, was verie sore afflicted; insomuch
that one miserie riding on anothers necke, the whole land was in danger of desolation
by ciuill dissention &amp; mutuall mutinies; as the poet noteth:</p>

<p>When he had well considered of the matter, and taken aduise with his councell, he
first sent ambassadours to the king of England, then lieng at Gisours to treat and conclude
a truce betw&eacute;ene them both for a certeine space, that they might talke of some
conclusion of agr&eacute;ement. King Henrie receiued the ambassadors verie courteouslie,
and granted that communication might be had of peace, but vtterlie denied anie abstinence
from warre, bicause he would not lose time, if the treatie sorted not to good
effect. Herevpon hauing his armie assembled at Maunt, he diuided the same into
thr&eacute;e parts, appointing the duke of Glocester with one part to go vnto the castell of
S. Germane in Laie, and to laie siege therevnto. The duke according to his commission,
comming before that castell, within a while constreined them within by continuall
skirmishes and assaults to diliuer vp the place into his hands. An other
part of the armie was sent vnto the castell of Montioie, which likewise by such fierce
assaults and manfull approches, as the Englishmen made thereto, was shortlie giuen
ouer and y&eacute;elded. The third part of the hoast went to Meulanc, a verie strong

<p>But the king deuised to fasten botes and barges togither, and to rere vp certeine

meanes approch the walles, wherewith those that had the towne in k&eacute;eping were so
put in feare, that their capteine was glad to come to a communication, &amp; agr&eacute;ed to
deliuer the towne into the kings hands, if no rescue came before the thirtith daie of
October next insuing. On which daie, for that no succours appeared, the towne
(according to the couenants) was giuen vp into the kings hands. Sir Thomas Ramston
was made capteine there, and after him sir Iohn Fastolfe. The king, whilest
these places were besieged, and thus brought vnder his subiection, continued for the
most part at Maunt; but yet oftentimes he went foorth to visit his campes, and to
s&eacute;e that nothing should be wanting, that might further the sp&eacute;edie dispatch of
his enterprises.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1420 An. Reg. 8.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A great victorie on the English side.</div>

<p>About the same time, there came againe ambassadours to him from Charles the
French king, &amp; from the yoong duke of Burgognie to treat with him of some good
conclusion of peace to be had; who had no such trust in their sute, but that he
doubted their meaning, and therefore ceassed not to proc&eacute;ed in the winning of townes
and castels, as he was in hand. Now when Christmasse approched, the king
withdrew to Rone, and there kept the solemnization of that feast, appointing in the
meane time his men of warre to be occupied as occasion serued. The earle of Salisburie
was sent to besiege the towne of Fresneie, the which after stout resistance made
at the first, shortlie after was deliuered to him to the kings vse. The earles Marshall
and Huntington, sir Iohn Gr&eacute;ene Cornewall, sir Philip L&eacute;ech, and diuerse other,
were sent into the countrie of Maine, where, not farre from the citie of Mens they
were incountered by a power of Frenchmen, which the Dolphin had sent against
them. There was at the first a sharpe bickering betwixt them, but in the end
the victorie remained with the Englishmen; so that manie of the Frenchmen were
slaine, and taken, and the residue chased out of the field. There were slaine (as
Thomas Walsingham saith) at the point of fiue thousand, and two hundred taken
prisoners, among whome was the marshall de Rous, and diuerse other of good
account. The two English earles remained there as victors, in the countrie which
was by the king to them assigned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">King Henrie condescendeth to a treatie of peace.</div>

<p>Whilest these victorious exploits were thus happilie atchiued by the Englishmen,
and that the king laie still at Rone, in giuing thanks to almightie God for the

duke of Burgognie to mooue him to peace. The king minding not to be reputed
for a destroier of the countrie, which he coueted to preserue, or for a causer of
christian bloud still to be spilt in his quarell, began so to incline and giue eare vnto
their sute and humble request, that at length (after often sending to and fro) and
that the bishop of Arras, and other men of honor had b&eacute;ene with him, and likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>

<p>Now was the French king and the qu&eacute;ene with their daughter Katharine at

pull backe one iot of such articles as the same duke should s&eacute;eke to preferre.
And therefore what n&eacute;edeth manie words, a truce tripartite was accorded betw&eacute;ene
the two kings and the duke, and their countries, and order taken that the king
of England should send in the companie of the duke of Burgognie his ambassadours
vnto Trois in Champaigne sufficientlie authorised to treat and conclude of so great
matter. The king of England, being in good hope that all his affaires should take
good successe as he could wish or desire, sent to the duke of Burgognie his vncle,
the duke of Excester, the earle of Salisburie, the bishop of Elie, the lord Fanhope,
the lord Fitz Hugh, sir Iohn Robsert, and sir Philip Hall, with diuerse doctors,
to the number of fiue hundred horsse, which in the companie of the duke of Burgognie

should in his st&eacute;ed haue the whole gouernment of the realme of France, as regent
thereof, with manie other couenants and articles, as after shall app&eacute;ere. To the
performance whereof, it was accorded, that all the nobles and estates of the realme
of France, as well spirituall as temporall, and also the cities and commonalties, citizens
and burgesses of townes, that were obeisant at that time to the French king,
should take a corporall oth. These articles were not at the first in all points brought
to a perfect conclusion. But after the effect and meaning of them was agr&eacute;ed vpon
by the commissioners, the Englishmen departed towards the king their maister, and
left sir Iohn Robsert behind, to giue his attendance on the ladie Katharine.</p>

<p>King Henrie being informed by them of that which they had doone, was well
content with the agr&eacute;ement and with all diligence prepared to go vnto Trois, and
therevpon hauing all things in readinesse, he being accompanied with his brethren
the dukes of Clarence and Glocester, the earles of Warwike, Salisburie, Huntington,
Eu, Tankeruile, and Longuile, and fift&eacute;ene thousand men of warre, went from Rone
to Pontoise; &amp; departing from thence the eight daie of Maie, came to saint Denis
two leagues from Paris, and after to Pontcharenton, where he left a strong garison of
men, with sir William Gascoigne, to k&eacute;epe the passage; and so then entering into
Brie, he tooke by the waie a castell which was kept against him, causing them that so
kept it, some to be hanged, and the residue to be led foorth with him as prisoners.
And after this k&eacute;eping on his iournie by Prouins, and Nogent, at length he came
to Trois.</p>

<p>The duke of Burgognie accompanied with manie noble men, receiued him two
leagues without the towne, and conueied him to his lodging. All his armie was
lodged in small villages thereabout. And after that he had reposed himselfe a little,
he went to visit the French king, the qu&eacute;ene, and the ladie Katharine, whome he
found in saint Peters church, where was a verie ioious m&eacute;eting betwixt them (and
this was on the twentith daie of Maie) and there the king of England, and the
ladie Katharine were affianced. After this, the two kings and their councell assembled
togither diuerse daies, wherein the first concluded agr&eacute;ement was in diuerse
points altered and brought to a certeinetie, according to the effect aboue mentioned.
When this great matter was finished, the kings sware for their parts to obserue
all the couenants of this league and agr&eacute;ement. Likewise the duke of Burgognie
and a great number of other princes and nobles which were present, receiued an
oth, the tenor whereof (as the duke of Burgognie vttered it in solemne words) thus
insueth, accordinglie as the same is exemplified by Titus Liuius De Foro Liuisiis
in Latine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A league betw&eacute;ene king Henrie &amp; the duke of Burgognie.</div>

<p>On the fourt&eacute;enth of Iune being fridaie, there was a solemn procession at London,
and a sermon at Paules crosse, in which the preacher openlie declared the effect of the
kings mariage, and the articles concluded vpon the same, by reason whereof (he said)
there must be a new great seale deuised, and the old broken, and in the new the kings
name with a new addition of his title as regent of France, and heire apparant of that
kingdome was to be ingrauen. Beside the league thus concluded by king Henrie
with the French king, and the whole bodie of the realme of France, there was a
priuat league accorded betwixt him and the duke of Burgognie, the effect wherof
was comprehended in articles as followeth.</p>

<p>1 First, that the duke of Burgognie should procure this peace latelie before concluded,
to be obserued firme and stable in all couenants and points therof, so far as he
by any meanes might further the same: in consideration whereof, one of the brethren
of king Henrie should take to wife one of the said duke of Burgognies sisters. 2 That
king Henrie should euer haue in singular fauour the said duke of Burgognie, as his
most d&eacute;ere brother, and support him in all his rights. 3 That the said duke, after the
deceasse of king Charles, should take an oth of fealtie to be true to K. Henrie &amp; his
heires, according to the forme &amp; tenor thereof before expressed, &amp; should in all things
be friend to king Henrie and his heires for euer. 4 That king Henrie should doo his
vttermost indeuour, that due punishment might be had for the murther of duke
Iohn, father to the said duke of Burgognie, aswell vpon Charles that named himselfe
Dolphin, as vpon others that were guiltie and priuie to that murther.</p>

<p>5 If the said Dolphin chanced to be taken, in battell or towne besieged, or if anie
other chanced so to be taken, that should be prooued guiltie or priuie to the murther
of the said duke Iohn, he should not be deliuered without iust punishment for his
d&eacute;eds, nor without the consent of the two kings Charles and Henrie, &amp; of the thr&eacute;e
estates of both the realmes. 6 In consideration of the great diligence, and painfull
trauell susteined by the duke of Burgognie, it was also agr&eacute;ed, that he should haue
by patent granted of king Charles and qu&eacute;ene Isabell a f&eacute;e of twentie thousand pounds
Parisien, of y&eacute;erelie reuenues, assigned foorth n&eacute;ere to the confines of his countrie, to
inioy the same to him and to his wife the duches Michaell, and to the heires males
betwixt them two, lawfullie begotten, to the obteining whereof, king Henrie should
shew all his furtherance; &amp; if it might not be brought to passe till king Henrie had
obteined the crowne of France, then should he s&eacute;e the same performed, vpon the receiuing
of his homage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The effect of king Henries oration to the French king.</div>

<p>The king of England, after all the articles of the said treaties and agr&eacute;ements were
concluded, passed and sworne vnto, made to the French king, the duke of Burgognie,
and other the French lords, a sumptuous banket; and before they departed from the
same, he sadlie and with great grauitie made to them a right pithie and sententious
oration, declaring to them both how profitable the ioining of the two kingdomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
should be to the subiects of the same, and also the right that he had thereto, being
by lineall descent of the womans side (which is the surest) rather a Frenchman than
an Englishman. And though he was an Englishman borne, yet he assured them to
tender the wealth of the realme of France, as much as he would the aduancement
of his owne natiue countrie of England.</p>

<p>Herewith, he inueied against Charles the Dolphin, being the head and onelie mainteiner
of all the ciuill discord, whose wicked nature, and cruell disposition, did well appeare in
the murther of the late duke of Burgognie. He therefore willed them, according
to their dutie, oth, and agr&eacute;ement, to stand with him, and helpe to reduce such a
stubborne and disloiall sonne vnto the obeisance of his father king Charles, that he
might shew himselfe conformable vnto such orders and decr&eacute;es, as they had taken,
appointed, and agr&eacute;ed vpon: and for his part, he promised to worship, loue, and
honor his father in law the said K. Charles, in place of his owne father, according to the
true mening of this concord and agr&eacute;ement, trusting the same to be a peace finall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The siege was laid the 16 of Iune.</div>

<p>And to conclude, he promised, that if they shewed themselues true and loiall to
him, according to the same agr&eacute;ement; the Ocean sea should sooner ceasse to flow,
and the bright sunne lose his light, than he would desist from dooing that which
became a prince to doo to his subiect, or a father to his naturall child. When he had
thus persuaded the nobilitie, and dispatched his businesse at Troies, he with all his
armie, hauing with him the French king, and the duke of Burgognie, departed from
thence the fourth of Iune; and vpon the seauenth daie of the same moneth, came
before the towne of Sens in Burgognie, which held on the Dolphins part: but after
foure daies siege, it was y&eacute;elded vnto the king, and there he made capteine, the lord
Genuille. From thence, he remooued to Monstreau ou fault Yonne, which towne
was taken on the thr&eacute;e and twentith daie of Iune, by assault, so that manie of the Dolphins
part were apprehended, before they could get to the castell.</p>

<p>Whilest the siege laie there, and before the towne was entred, the duke of Bedford
came thither vnto the king, bringing with him a faire retinue of soldiers out of England.
After the getting of the towne, the castell being well vittelled and manned,
denied to render, and therefore was it enuironed with a strong siege. During the
which, the duke of Burgognie was informed, in what place of the towne the duke
his father was buried, who was slaine there (as before you haue heard) and now his
corps was taken vp againe by his sonnes appointment, and seared, and so conueied
vnto Digeon in high Burgognie, and there buried by his father Philip: to the end
that the remembrance of him should remaine to posterities, by the reseruation of
some monument abiding in the place of his interment, after that his bodie was consumed,
and his naturall countenance forgotten. Which is the last point of reuerend
dutie (as we may well thinke) which pietie of children towards their parents dooth
require; namelie, that they be decentlie buried when they be departed; and that their
graues or toome stones may put vs that are aliue in mind of going the same waie, and

in conclusion, he and his rendred themselues simplie, their liues onelie saued, six w&eacute;ekes

<p>Now to proc&eacute;ed in our processe of France. After the thus winning of the towne
and castell of Monstreau; the king departing from thence, came to Melun vpon Seine,
the thirt&eacute;enth daie of Iulie, and besieged it round about, hauing then in companie
with him the French king, and the yoong king of Scots, the dukes of Burgognie,
Clarence, Bedford, Glocester, and Bar, the prince of Orajnge, and one and twentie
earles, besides lords, barons, &amp; knights, equal to lords in degr&eacute;e, to the number of
seauen and fiftie, what of England and France; and beside also fift&eacute;ene maister
soldiers. This siege continued the space almost of seuen moneths, or (as Thomas
Walsingham saith) fouret&eacute;ene w&eacute;ekes, and foure daies, with skirmishing, scaling
assaulting, and defending, to the losse (no doubt) of both parts. Capteine of this
towne was one monsieur de Barbason, a Gascoine of such experience and approoued
valiancie in wars, that his renowme and fame was spred through the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Titus Liuius.</i></div>

<p>At the first laieng of the siege, he called all the soldiers there in garrison, and
likewise the townesmen afore him, and warned them all on paine of death, that none
of them should be so hardie, as to treat, or once to motion anie word of surrendring
the towne, or of comming to anie composition or agr&eacute;ement with the two
kings; except they made him being their capteine priuie thereto, before they attempted
anie such thing. &para; In the meane season, the French qu&eacute;ene, the qu&eacute;ene of
England, and the duches of Burgognie, lieng at Corbeill, came diuers times to visit
their husbands, and to s&eacute;e their fr&eacute;ends; whome the king of England highlie feasted
and louinglie interteined, that euerie creature reported great honour of him. This
towne of Melun s&eacute;emed verie strong, both by reason of the riuer of Seine, which
compassed part thereof, and also by strong walles, turrets, ditches, and bulworks
made about it.</p>

<p>The king therefore, to take awaie all the issues and entries from them within,
made a bridge ouer the riuer, able to beare horsses and carriage: and againe, appointed
diuerse botes furnished with men of warre, to k&eacute;epe the streame; so that they
within should haue no waie to come abroad, either by water or land; yet on a
daie, the Frenchmen sailed foorth, and assailed the English lodgings, where the
earle of Warwike was incamped on the east side of the towne, not farre from the duke
of Burgognie; but by the valiant prowesse and manlie courage of the Englishmen,
the enimies were easilie beaten backe and constreined to retire into the towne againe
with their losse. H&eacute;ere is to be remembred, that during this siege before Melun,
there came to the king the duke of Bauiere, the kings brother in law (but the kings
sister that had b&eacute;ene married to him, was not then liuing) and brought with him
seauen hundred well appointed horssemen, which were reteined to serue the king,
and right worthilie they bare themselues, and therefore most liberallie recompensed
at the kings hand, for the time they continued in his seruice.</p>

<p>The king inforced this siege by all waies and meanes possible, to bring the towne
into subiection, as well by mines as otherwise, but they within the towne so valiantlie
behaued themselues, as well by countermines (whereby at length they entered
into the kings mines) as by other waies of resistance, that by force of assaults it
was not thought anie easie matter to win the same. It fortuned on a daie, that
whilest there rose a contention betwixt two lords of the kings host, who should haue
the honor to go first into the mine, to incounter with the Frenchmen, that now had
brought their mine through into the English mines, and made barriers betwixt, that they
might safelie come and fight with the Englishmen: the king (to auoid the strife)
entered the mine himselfe first of all other, and by chance came to fight hand to
hand with the lord Barbason, who was likewise entered the mine before all other of
them within the towne.</p>

<p>After they had fought a good season togither, at length they agr&eacute;ed to discouer either

likewise told him, that he was the king of England. Wherevpon, Barbason perceiuing
with whome he had fought, caused the barriers foorthwith to be closed, and withdrew
into the citie, and the king returned backe to his campe. At length, vittels
within the towne began to faile, and the pestilence began to wax hot, so that the
lord Barbason began to treat; and in conclusion, about the middest of Nouember (as
Fabian saith) the towne was y&eacute;elded vpon certeine conditions, whereof one was, that
all that were consenting to the death of the duke of Burgognie, should be deliuered
to the king of England, of whome the lord Barbason was suspected to be one. The
king sent them vnder the conduct of his brother the duke of Clarence, to the citie of
Paris, whereof the French king made him capteine, and so at his comming thither,
he tooke possession of the Bastill of S. Anthonie, the Loure, the house of N&eacute;elle, and
the place of Bois de Vincennes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Titus Liuius.</i></div>

<p>Monsieur de Barbason was accused by the duke of Burgognie, and his sisters as
guiltie to their fathers death; but he in open court defended himselfe as not guiltie
of that crime, granting ind&eacute;ed and confessing, that he was one of the familiar seruants
to the Dolphin, but that he was priuie or consenting to the death of the duke of
Burgognie, he vtterlie denied. Wherevpon he was not condemned, neither yet acquited,
by reason of such presumptions and coniectures as were alledged and brought
against him, so that he remained in prison at Paris and else-where, the space of nine
yeares, till at length, being brought vnto castell Galliard, it chanced that the same
castell was woone by those of the Dolphins part, and he being as then prisoner
there, escaped out of danger, and so by that means was set at libertie, as after shall
appeare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A note in law of armes.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>W. P.</i></div>

<p>Some write, that he had b&eacute;ene put to death, if he had not appealed from king Henries
sentence, vnto the Judgement of the officers at armes; alledging, that by the lawe of
armes, no man hauing his brother in armes within his danger, afterwards ought to
put him to death for any cause or quarell. And that he was the kings brother in
armes he prooued it, for that he had fought with him hand to hand within the mines
(as before y&eacute;e haue heard) which combat was thought of equall force by the heralds,
as if he had fought with the king bodie to bodie, within solemne lists. The credit of
this matter we leaue to the consideration of the readers. The earle of Huntington
was made capteine of Melum. In defense of this towne and castell, the French had
gotten vnto them manie Scots. At the siege h&eacute;ere the king kept with him yoong
Iames of Scotland, who sent to those Scots, that they should come put and y&eacute;eld
them vnto him, and not to stand in armes against their liege lord and king; but they
gaue word backe againe, they could not take him for king, that was in the power of
another, and so kept them in hold and in their armor still. King Henrie vpon
winning of these forts, for their rebellion against their prince, which they would
haue to be counted constancie, and for their contemptuous answer vnto him, twentie
of the proudest, in example of the rest, caused he there to be hanged at once.</p>

<div class="sidenote">King Henrie is receiued in at Paris.</div>

<p>From thence the king departed with his armie vnto Corbeill, where the French
king and the two qu&eacute;enes then soiourned; and after, both the kings, accompanied
with the dukes of Bedford, Burgognie, Glocester, and Excester, and the earls of
Warwike and Salisburie, with a great number of noble men and knights, set foorth
towards Paris, whome the citizens in good order met without the gates, and the
cleargie also with solemne procession. All the str&eacute;ets were hanged with rich clothes,
the two kings rode togither (the king of England giuing the vpper hand to his father
in lawe) though the great citie of Paris, to our ladie church, where after they had
said their deuotions, they departed vnto their lodgings; the French king to the house
of S. Paule, and the king of England to the castell of Louer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duchess of Burgognie hir appeale.</div>

<p>The next daie, the two qu&eacute;enes made their entrie and were receiued with like
solemnities, as their husbands were the day before. During all the season that these

as of the nobles of the temporaltie, in the which, the kings set as iudges, before
whom the duches of Burgognie by hir proctor, appealed the Dolphin, and seauen
other, for the murther of duke Iohn hir husband. To the which appeale, the counsell
of the other part made diuerse offers of amends, as well of foundations of chantries
for pr&eacute;ests, to praie for the soule, as recompense of monie to the widow and
children; for the finall determination whereof, the kings, to take further aduise and
counsell therein, appointed another daie.</p>

the two kings and thereto euerie noble man, spirituall gouernour and temporall ruler,
set to their seales, which instruments were sent to the kings treasurie of his eschecker
at Westminster safelie to be kept, where they yet remaine. The French king at
the same time being in good and perfect state of health, openlie there in parlement
declared, that peace was concluded, accorded, and made by his fr&eacute;e assent, and
with the aduise of all the councell of France, and that he would for his owne part
and that his successors ought for their parts, obserue and k&eacute;epe the same, with all

<p>During the time that the two kings thus soiourned in Paris, the French king kept
a small port, verie few, and those of the meaner sort resorting vnto his court; but
the king of England kept such a solemne state, with so plentifull an house, and
shewed himselfe so bountifull in gifts, and setting foorth of warlike shewes and
princelie pastimes, that all the noble men and other resorted to his palace to s&eacute;e his

causes, remooue officers, reforme things that were amisse, and caused a new come to be
made, called a salute, wherein were the armes of France, and the armes of England
and France quarterlie stamped. Also, to set all things in quiet, he constituted sir
Gilbert Umfreuile capteine of Melun, with a good number of valiant soldiers, to remaine
there in garrison, and the earle of Huntington (coosine germane to the king) was
deputed capteine at Bois de Vincenes; and the duke of Excester, with fiue hundred
men of warre, was assigned to k&eacute;epe Paris. Thus had king Henrie (when he was
constituted gouernour of the land) the disposing of prouinces, townes, and castels at

<p>But while these things were thus adooing in England, the duke of Clarence,
the kings lieutenant in France and Normandie, assembled togither all the garrisons
of Normandie, at the towne of Bernaie, and from thence departed to the countrie
of Maine, and at Pont le Gene he passed the riuer of Yonne, and rode through
all the countrie to Lucie, where he passed the riuer of Loire, and entered into
Aniou, and came before the citie of Angiers, where he made manie knights, that
to saie, sir William Ros, sir Henrie Goddard, sir Rowland Rider, sir Thomas Beaufort,
called the bastard of Clarence, and diuerse other; and after that he had forraied,
burnt, and spoiled the countrie, he returned with preie and pillage to the towne
of Beaufort in the vallie, where he was aduertised, that a great number of his enimies,
Frenchmen, Scots, Spaniards, and other were assembled togither, at a place
called Viell Bauge, that is Old Baugie, with the duke of Alanson, calling himselfe
lieutenant generall for the Dolphin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forgusa, a Lumbard betraieth the duke of Clarence.</div>

<p>The duke of Clarence had a Lombard resorting vnto him, reteined with the part

his enimies, to whome he reported, that their number was but small, &amp; not of puisance
to match with halfe the power of his strong armie, intising him with assurance
of victorie, to set on the Frenchmen. The duke like a couragious prince, assembled
togither all the horssemen of the armie, and left the archers vnder the guiding
of the bastard of Clarence, and two Portingales, capteins of Fresnie le vicount,
saieng, that he onelie and the nobles would haue the honor of that iournie. When
the duke was passed a certeine streict and narrow passage, he espied his enimies
ranged in good order of battell, by the monition of the Lombard, which had sold
him to his enimies, &amp; his aduersaries had laid such ambushments at the streicts, that
the duke by no waie without battell could either retire or fl&eacute;e.</p>

<p>The Englishmen s&eacute;eing this, valiantlie set on their enimies, who were foure to

the lord Ros, sir Gilbert Umfreuile earle of Angus, and sir Iohn Lomlie, sir
Robert Verend, and almost two thousand Englishmen: &amp; the earles of Summerset,
Suffolke, and Perch, the lord Fitz Water, sir Iohn Berkelie, sir Rafe Neuile, sir

hundred of the best men of warre they had, so that they gained not much.</p>

<p>The bastard of Clarence which tarried at Beaufort, being informed of the great
number of the Frenchmen, made forward with all the archers, to come to the succor
of the duke, but they came too late. For the Frenchmen, hearing of the approching
of the archers, fled with their prisoners, and left the bodie of the duke, and other
the dead carcases behind them. The archers buried them all sauing the dukes corpse,
which with great solemnitie was sent to England, and buried at Canturburie beside
his father. After this the Englishmen burnt and spoiled the countrie of Maine,
and so returned to Alanson, and after departed euerie man to his garrison. This

<div class="sidenote">King Henrie saileth into France againe.</div>

<p>After this, he called his high court of parlement, in the which he declared with
such great wisedome &amp; grauitie, the acts which had b&eacute;ene doone in France, the
state of the time present, and what was necessary to be prouided for the time to
come (if they would looke to haue that iewell and high kingdome, for the which

the clergie beneuolentlie offred a double disme. And bicause no delaie should be
in the kings affaires for lacke of paiment, the bishop of Winchester the kings vncle
lent vnto him twentie thousand pounds, to be paid him againe of the same dismes.
When all things necessarie for this iournie were readie and prepared, he sent his
brother the duke of Bedford before him to Calis with all his armie, being (as some
write) foure thousand men of armes, and twentie thousand archers and others; though
some haue written, that the whole armie passed not twelue thousand of one and

<p>The king himselfe shortlie after, about the middle of Maie, passed the seas to

where the French king and the qu&eacute;ene as then soiourned. The duke of Burgognie
also that had receiued him at Monstruell, attended him to Dowast in Ponthieu,
and there hauing taking leaue of him for six daies, returned now againe to him,
according to his promise. Then did they consult togither about their affaires, and
appointed in all hast to fight with the Dolphin, and to raise the siege of Chartres
which he had there planted. Herevpon, the king of England with all his puissance,
came to the towne of Mante, and thither repaired the duke of Burgognie; but yer
they departed from thence, they had knowledge, that the Dolphin hearing of the
puissant armie of the king of England approching towards him, was recoiled with his
people towards Towers in Touraine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king of Scots serueth king Henrie. Dreux besieged &amp; rendred to the Englishmen.</div>

<p>Herevpon the king of England incontinentlie, did not onelie send backe the duke
of Burgognie into Picardie, to resist the attempts of sir Iaques de Harecourt, which
made war in that countrie for the Dolphin; but also appointed the king of Scots,
with the duke of Glocester, to besiege the towne of Dreux. They comming thither
about the eight&eacute;enth of Iulie, planted siege on euerie side, both of the towne and
castell; and what with power of batrie, and other forcible meanes, so constreined
them within, that on the eight daie of August they compounded, that if no sufficient
rescue came to raise the siege, before the end of twelue daies next insuing, both
the towne and castell should be deliuered to the king of Englands vse, so as the
soldiers might depart with their goods whither they would, except one Englishman,
which was knowen to be amongst them, being fled for treason out of the kings
dominions.</p>

<p>On the twentith daie of August, which was the day of the appointment, the king
of Scots receiued the towne and castell to the behoofe of his souereigne lord the king
of England, who (during all the time of the siege) laie at Moraumall. The townesmen
that would remaine still in their houses, were sworne to be true subiects to the
king; and the other which refused, departed with the souldiers. The Englishman
that was excepted, was deliuered according to the couenants; and after executed,
as he had deserued. The earle of Worcester was made capteine of Dreux, and
sir Henrie Mortimer bailiffe there. This doone, the king hearing that the Dolphin
should be at Baugencie, assembling his power, hasted thitherwards: but at his comming
into those parties, he found no appearance of enimies in the field, and so
he remained there fift&eacute;ene daies.</p>

douting the English puissance, conueied all the vittels foorth of those quarters,

through Gastinois, till he came to Vignie sur Yonne, where he remained for
a season, to refresh his people that were sore trauelled, in that painefull passed iournie:
in which the king lost not onelie manie of his men for lacke of vittels, but also a
great number of horsses and carriages. Some haue written, that about the same
time, he should win the citie of Sens, otherwise called the kings new towne by surrender;
but after he had remained for a time at Vignie, we find that he remoued to
Paris, where he was honorablie receiued. &para; For he came among them as one hauing
empire and dominion in his hand, so that to him they were no lesse forward in submission
for feare of his indignation, than readie to giue him all the interteinement that

<p>Shortlie after, considering with himselfe that the towne of Meaux in Brie, being

middes of his new gotten subiects; he determined to take awaie the open scruple that
might poison and infect the members, dwelling hard by: wherefore with a great
number of earles and barons in his companie, he came to besiege it. This towne was
no lesse well vittelled than manned, and no better manned than fortified; so that the
king could neither haue it to him deliuered at his pleasure, nor gaine it by assault,
without the great losse of his people: yet neuerthelesse, he determined not to depart
till he had got it by one meane or other. The riuer of Marne diuided this towne
into two parts, so that there was no enterie from the one into the other, but by a bridge,
raised vp, and made ouer the riuer, susteined with manie arches. The one part is
called the citie, and the other la March being the strongest and best fortified. The
king first lodged a mile off in a castell, and sent the duke of Excester to begin the
siege, which he did according to his instructions, vpon the sixt of October.</p>

<p>Shortlie after, the king himselfe came, and lodged in the abbeie of Pharon, the

the earle of Warwike directlie against that part that is called la March. They within
defended themselues right valiantlie, so that the Englishmen were not all at their
ease, but specialie through lacke of vittels manie died, and manie fell sicke, by reason
whereof, no small number returned home into England; wherein the meane time, on
the first of December, a parlement was called and holden at Westminster, by the
duke of Bedford, gouernour of the realme in the kings absence. &para; In this parlement,

But when he heard reported the place of his natiuitie; were it that he warned by some

<div class="sidenote">1422</div>

<p>The king held his Christmasse at the siege before Meaux, for he would not giue ouer
that siege, although his armie was greatlie diminished, by reason of lacke of vittels,
extreame cold, foule weather, and other discommodities that bred great store of diseases
and sickenesse among his people; notwithstanding, all the helps and means that
might be, he deuised to remedie the same: so that beside such as died, as well of
sickenesse as by the enimies hand, manie returned home into their countries. But yet
he ceassed not to continue the siege, beating the walles with his ordinance, and
casting downe bulworkes and rampiers on ech side the towne, made approches as well
by water as land, with mightie engines deuised of boords to defend the Englishmen,
as they approched the walles, and gaue assaults. The walles also were in diuerse
places vndermined.</p>

<p>After this, the Englishmen found meanes, by bridges made of boats, to passe the
riuer; but yet the souldiers and other within defended their rampiers and breaches most
stoutlie, and with guns and quarrels still shot at the Englishmen, of whome they slue
manie; and among other the earle of Worcester was slaine, with a bullet of the great
artillerie, &amp; the lord Clifford with a quarrell of a crossebow; yet the Englishmen still
wan ground, and got n&eacute;erer and n&eacute;erer to the walles. They also woone the chiefest part
of a bridge from the enimies, and kept watch and ward vpon and about the same. The
earle of Warwike had also taken a Vaumure from them of the market place, built on
the southside thereof, able to receiue and lodge a good number of men, which seruing
to good purpose, for the better brideling of them within, he caused to be kept, and
thus were they within Meaux sore oppressed on euerie side.</p>

all the men of warre into the same, leauing none in the other part of the citie, but the
commons, and such as were not able to doo any auaileable seruice in the warre. The
king aduertised hereof commanded in all hast to assault the citie, which was quicklie
doone; so that the citie by fine force was within thr&eacute;e houres taken and spoiled; and
the same daie the market place besieged round about, and a mill woone adioining vnto
the same. In Aprill, the qu&eacute;ene passed ouer into France, with a faire retinue of men,
vnder the conduct of the duke of Bedford, the duke of Glocester remaining lord
gouernour of the realme in his place. At hir comming thither, she was so welcommed
and honorablie receiued, first of hir husband, and after of hir father and mother,
that she appeared to be no lesse loued of hir noble husband, than of hir d&eacute;ere and

<div class="sidenote">Oliuer Mannie.</div>

<p>Whilest the siege still continued before Meaux, Oliuer Mannie a valiant man of

sware neuer to beare armour against the king of England) assembled a great number
of men of warre, as well Britaines as Frenchmen, that is to saie, the lord Monthorchier,
the lord of Coinon, the lord of Chatelgiron, the lord Tintignace, the lord de
la Howssaie, and diuerse other, which entered into the countrie of Constantine in
Normandie, and robbed and killed the Englishmen, where they might either espie or
take them at their due aduantage. But the earle of Suffolke k&eacute;eper of the marches,
hearing of their dooings, sent for the lord Scales, sir Iohn Aston bailiffe of Constantine,
sir William Hall, sir Iohn Banaster, and many other, out of the garrisons
within that territorie, the which incountred with their enimies at a place called Le

<p>There was a sore fight and a long betwixt them, but finallie the Frenchmen were

lord of Chatellgiron, and thr&eacute;e hundred other: and there were taken prisoners, the
lord de la Howssaie, and sir Oliuer Mannie, with thr&eacute;escore others. The king pardoned
sir Oliuer Mannie his life, though he ill deserued so great a benefit, for that he
had broken his oth and promise, but he was sent into England, there to learne to
speake English, and so being brought to London, shortlie after died, being as then a
verie aged man, &amp; was buried in the white friers. &para; But here note (by the waie) the
roiall hart of this king, who as he tempered all his actions with singular circumspection;
so with a pitifull mind he pondered the miserie of his enimies; so that when he
might (Iure belli, by the law of armes) haue spoiled them of goods and life, he diuerse
times spared both; with clemencie co&#x0304;monlie making conquest of them, who s&eacute;emed
by open hostilitie scarse conquerable.</p>

<p>The king lieng still before the market place at Meaux in Brie (as ye haue heard)
sore beat the wals with his ordinance, and cast downe bulworkes and rampiers on euerie
side the towne, so that he had made an open breach for his people to enter. Wherof
the lord of Offemont being aduertised, with a companie of chosen persons sent by
the Dolphin, assaied in the night season to enter the towne, to the succours of them
within. But though diuerse of his people got ouer the walles, by helpe of ladders
which they had set vp; yet such was his chance, that as he passed a planke, to haue
come to the walles, he fell into a d&eacute;epe ditch; and in the meane time, the Englishmen
perceiuing by the noise what the matter meant, came running to the ditch, tooke the
lord of Offemont, and slue diuerse of his companie that stood in defense.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The conditions of the surrender of Meaux into the kings hands.</div>

<p>The capteins within, perceiuing in what case they stood, by reason their succours
were thus intercepted, and doubting to be taken by assault, for that they wanted
munition and weapon, began to treat with the king of England, who appointed the
earle of Warwike, and the lord Hungerford, to commune with them; and in conclusion
an accord was taken, and so the towne and market place with all the goods
were deliuered into the king of Englands hands, the tenth daie of Maie, in the yeare
1422. The appointment taken with them of this towne was this, that they should
y&eacute;eld themselues simplie vnto the kings pleasure, their liues onlie saued: and herevpon
manie of them were sent ouer into England, amongst whome was the bishop of that
towne, which shortlie after his arriuall here fell sicke and died.</p>

<p>There were also foure persons excepted, against whome the king might by order of
law and iustice proc&eacute;ed as he saw cause, for their faults and trespasses committed.
As first, the capteine of the towne, named the bastard of Vaureu, the which had
doone manie gr&eacute;euous oppressions to the people of the countrie thereabouts, in spoiling
them of their goods and ransoming them at his pleasure. He had also put diuerse
to death most cruellie, when they were not able to paie such finance and ransomes as
he demanded. Wherevpon, being now put to death himselfe, his bodie was hanged
vpon a tr&eacute;e that stood on an hill without the towne, on the which he had caused both
husbandmen and townesmen, with other prisoners, to be hanged before time. His
standard also, which was woont to be borne before him in battell, was set vp in the
same tr&eacute;e. The bailiife also of the towne, and two of the ch&eacute;efest burgesses that had
b&eacute;ene of counsell with him in his vnlawfull dooings, were likewise executed. Also
beside these, there were found in this towne diuerse that were accused to be guiltie of
the duke of Burgognies death, wherefore they were put to their triall, in the parlement
at Paris, and some of them being found guiltie, were executed.</p>

Meaux, and the other fortresses, he returned againe to Bois de Vincennes, and being
there receiued of the king and qu&eacute;ene of France, and of the qu&eacute;ene his wife the
thirtith daie of Maie, being Whitsun &eacute;euen, they remooued all togither vnto Paris,
where the king of England lodged in the castell of Loure, and the French king in the
house of saint Paule. These two kings kept great estate with their qu&eacute;enes, at this
high feast of Pentecost, but the king of Englands court greatlie exc&eacute;eded, so that all
the resort was thither. The Parisiens that beheld his princelie port &amp; high magni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>ficence,
iudged him rather an emperour then a king, and their owne king to be in
respect of him like a duke or marquesse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cosneie besieged by the Dolphin.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king falleth sicke.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Cosneie rescued by the duke of Bedford.</div>

<p>The Dolphin hauing knowledge by espials where the king of England and his
power laie, came with all his puissance ouer the riuer of Loire, and besieged Cosneie,
a towne situate vpon that riuer, a six score miles distant from Paris, and appointed
part of his armie to waste and destroie the confines of the duchie of Burgognie, to
the intent to diuide the power of the king of England, from the strength of the duke of
Burgognie, supposing (as it came to passe ind&eacute;ed) that the duke would make hast towards
Burgognie, to defend his owne lands. In the meane time they within Cosneie
were so hard handled, that they promised to render their towne to the Dolphin, if
they were not rescued by the king of England within ten daies. King Henrie hearing
these newes would not send anie one creature, but determined to go himselfe to the
raising of that siege, and so with all diligence came to the towne of Corbeill, and so
to Senlis, where (whether it were with heat of the aire, or that he with his dailie
labour were f&eacute;ebled or weakened) he began to wax sicke, yea and so sicke, that he
was constreined to tarrie, and send his brother the duke of Bedford to rescue them of
Cosneie, which he did to his high honor. For the Dolphin hearing that the duke of
Bedford was comming to raise his siege departed thence into Berrie, to his great dishonor,
and lesse gaine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Britaine sendeth ambassadors to the K. of England.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The king of England is brought sicke to Bois de Vincennes.</div>

<p>About the same time, the duke of Britaine sent his chancellor the bishop of Maunts,
with the bishop of Vannes, and others of his councell, as ambassadors from him vnto
king Henrie, with full commission, to ratifie and allow for him and his people the
peace concluded at Troies: but by reason of the kings gr&eacute;euous sicknesse, nothing
was then doone in that matter. Neuerthelesse, the duke himselfe in person came
afterwards to Amiens, and there performed that which he had appointed his ambassadors
at this time, in his name, to haue doone and accomplished. In the meane season,
king Henrie waxed sicker and sicker, and so in an horsselitter was conueied to Bois
de Vincennes, to whome shortlie after repaired the dukes of Bedford and Glocester,
&amp; the earles of Salisburie and Warwike, whome the king louinglie welcomed, and
s&eacute;emed glad of their presence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His aduise vpon his death bed.</div>

<p>Now, when he saw them pensife for his sicknesse, and great danger of life wherein
he presentlie laie, he with manie graue, courteous, and pithie words, recomforted
them the best he could, and therewith exhorted them to be trustie and faithfull vnto
his sonne, and to s&eacute;e that he might be well and vertuouslie brought vp. And as concerning
the rule and gouernance of his realms, during the minoritie and yoong yeares
of his said sonne, he willed them to ioine togither in fr&eacute;endlie loue and concord,
k&eacute;eping continuall peace and amitie with the duke of Burgognie, and neuer to make
treatie with Charles that called himselfe Dolphin of Vienne, by the which anie part
either of the crowne of France, or of the duches of Normandie and Guien may be
lessened or diminished; and further, that the duke of Orleance, and the other princes
should still remaine prisoners, till his sonne came to lawfull age, least returning
home againe, they might kindle more fire in one daie than might be quenched
in thr&eacute;e.</p>

<p>He further aduised them, that if they thought it necessarie, that it should be good
to haue his brother Humfreie duke of Glocester to be protector of England, during
the nonage of his sonne, and his brother the duke of Bedford, with the helpe of the
duke of Burgognie to rule and to be regent of France, eommanding him with fire
and sword to persecute the Dolphin, till he had either brought him to reason and
obeisance, or else to driue and expell him out of the realme of France. And herewith
he protested vnto them, that neither the ambitious desire to inlarge his dominions,
neither to purchase vaine renowme and worldlie fame, nor anie other consideration
had mooued him to take the warres in hand; but onelie that in prosecuting his iust
title, he might in the end atteine to a perfect peace, and come to enioie those p&eacute;eces
of his inheritance, which to him of right belonged: and that before the beginning
of the same warres, he was fullie persuaded by men both wise and of great holinesse
of life, that vpon such intent he might and ought both begin the same warres, and
follow them, till he had brought them to an end iustlie and rightlie, and that without
all danger of Gods displeasure or perill of soule.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He departed this life the last of August 1422.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The comme&#x0304;dation of king Henrie the fift as is expressed by maist.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Hall.</i></div>

<p>The noble men present, promised to obserue his precepts, and to performe his
desires; but their hearts were so pensife, and replenished with sorrow, that one could
not for w&eacute;eping behold an other. Then he said the seauen psalmes, and receiued the
sacrament, and in saieng the psalmes of the passion ended his daies h&eacute;ere in this world, at
Bois saint Vincent, the last of August, in the yeare a thousand foure hundred twentie
and two. This Henrie was a king, of life without spot, a prince whome all men loued,
and of none disdained, a capteine against whome fortune neuer frowned, nor mischance
once spurned, whose people him so seuere a iusticer both loued and obeied (and
so humane withall) that he left no offense vnpunished, nor fr&eacute;endship vnrewarded; a
terrour to rebels, and suppressour of sedition, his vertues notable, his qualities most
praise-worthie.</p>

<p>In strength and nimblenesse of bodie from his youth few to him comparable, for
in wrestling, leaping, and running, no man well able to compare. In casting of great
iron barres and heauie stones he excelled commonlie all men, neuer shrinking at cold,
nor slothfull for heat; and when he most laboured, his head commonlie vncouered;
no more wearie of harnesse than a light cloake, verie valiantlie abiding at n&eacute;eds both
hunger and thirst; so manfull of mind as neuer s&eacute;ene to quinch at a wound, or to smart
at the paine; nor to turne his nose from euill sauour, nor close his eies from smoke
or dust; no man more moderate in eating and drinking, with diet not delicate, but
rather more m&eacute;et for men of warre, than for princes, or tender stomachs. Euerie honest
person was permitted to come to him, sitting at meale, where either secretlie or
openlie to declare his mind. High and weightie causes as well betw&eacute;ene men of
warre and other he would gladlie heare, and either determined them himselfe, or else
for end committed them to others. He slept verie little, but that verie soundlie, in
so much that when his soldiers soong at nights, or minstrels plaied, he then slept
fastest; of courage inuincible, of purpose vnmutable, so wisehardie alwaies, as feare
was banisht from him; at euerie alarum he first in armor and formost in ordering.
In time of warre such was his prouidence, bountie and hap, as he had true intelligence
not onelie what his enimies did, but what they said and intended; of his deuises
and purposes few, before the thing was at the point to be done, should be made
priuie.</p>

<p>He had such knowledge in ordering and guiding an armie, with such a gift to
incourage his people, that the Frenchmen had constant opinion he could neuer be
vanquished in battell. Such wit, such prudence, and such policie withall, that he
neuer enterprised any thing, before he had fullie debated and forecast all the maine
chances that might happen, which doone with all diligence and courage he set his
purpose forward. What policie he had in finding present remedies for sudden misch&eacute;eues,
and what engines in sauing himselfe and his people in sharpe distresses: were
it not that by his acts they did plainlie appeare, hard were it by words to make them
credible. Wantonnesse of life and thirst in auarice had he quite quenched in him;
vertues in d&eacute;ed in such an estate of souereigntie, youth, and power, as verie rare,
so right commendable in the highest degr&eacute;e. So staied of mind and countenance
beside, that neuer iolie or triumphant for victorie, nor sad or damped for losse or
misfortune. For bountifulnesse and liberalitie, no man more fr&eacute;e, gentle, and
franke, in bestowing rewards to all persons, according to their deserts: for his saieng
was, that he neuer desired monie to k&eacute;epe but to giue and spend.</p>

<p>Although that storie properlie serues not for theme of praise or dispraise, yet what
in breuitie may well be remembred, in truth would not be forgotten by sloth, were
it but onlie to remaine as a spectacle for magnanimitie to haue alwaies in eie, and for
incouragement to nobles in honourable enterprises. Knowen be it therefore, of person
and forme was this prince rightlie representing his heroicall affects, of stature
and proportion tall and manlie, rather leane than grose, somewhat long necked and
blacke haired, of countenance amiable, eloquent and graue was his sp&eacute;ech, and of
great grace and power to persuade: for conclusion, a maiestie was he that both liued
&amp; died a paterne in princehood, a lode-starre in honour, and mirrour of magnificence:
the more highlie exalted in his life, the more d&eacute;epelie lamented at his death, and
famous to the world alwaie. Peter Basset (a ch&eacute;efe man in his chamber) affirmed
that he deceassed of a pleurisie, though the Scots and French set it downe to be of
saint Feacres disease, that they saie was a palsie with a crampe, which Enguerant
reports to be saint Anthonies fire, but neither of them trulie. &para; Anglorum pr&aelig;lia
saith, that it was a sharpe feuer, which happening vnto him (wearied with the broiles
of warre) in a verie vnseasonable time of the yeare, namelie the dogdaies, tormented
him the sorer, and grew to be not onelie dangerous, but also desperat; for it left him
not till life was extinguished: the poets report is, as followeth:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Crumwell.</div>

<p>His bodie imbalmed and closed in lead, was laid in a chariot roiall, richlie apparelled
with cloth of gold. Vpon his coffin was laid a representation of his person,
adorned with robes, diadem, scepter, &amp; ball, like a king; the which chariot, six
horsses drew richlie trapped, with seuerall appointments; the first with the armes of
S. George, the second with the armes of Normandie, the third of king Arthur, the
fourth of saint Edward, the fift of France, and the sixt with the armes of England
and France. On this same chariot gaue attendance Iames K. of Scots, the
principall mourner, king Henries vncle Thomas duke of Excester, Richard earle of
Warwike, the earle of March Edmund, the earle of Stafford Humfrie, the earle of
Mortaigne Edmund Beaufort, the lord Fitz Hugh Henrie, the lord Hungerford Walter,
sir Robert Robsert lord Bourchier, sir Iohn Cornwall lord Fanhope, and the lord
Crumwell were the other mourners. The lord Louell, the lord Audeleie, the lord
Morleie, the lord Sowch bare the baners of saints and auoouries, as then they were
called; the baron of Dudleie bare the standard, and the earle of Longuile the baner.
The hachments were caried onelie by capteins to the number of twelue; and round
about the chariot rode fiue hundred men of armes all in blacke armour, their horsses
barbed blacke, and they with the but ends of their speares vpwards.</p>

<p>The conduct of this dolorous funerall was committed to sir William Philip, treasuror
of the kings houshold, and to sir William Porter, his ch&eacute;efe caruer, and others.
Beside this, on euerie side of the chariot went thr&eacute;e hundred persons, holding long
torches, &amp; lords bearing baners, banerols, and penons. With this funerall appointment
was he conueied from Bois de Vincennes, to Paris, and so to Rone, to Abuile,
to Calis, to Douer, from thence thorough London to Westminster, where he
was interred with such solemne ceremonies, mourning of lords, praier of priests
and such lamenting of commons, as neuer before then the like was s&eacute;ene in England.
Shortlie after this solemne buriall, his sorowfull qu&eacute;ene returned into England, and
kept hir estate with the yoong king hir sonne.</p>

<p>Thus ended this puissant prince his most noble and fortunate reigne, whose life
(saith Hall) though cruell Atropos abbreuiated; yet neither fire, malice nor fretting
time shall appall his honour, or blot out the glorie of him that in so small time had
doone so manie and roiall acts. [In this yeare, the one and twentith of October
deceassed the gentle and welbeloued Charles French king the sixt of that name, who
was buried at S. Denis.] &para; So that betw&eacute;ene the death of these two kings, namelie
the one of England, the other of France, there was no great space of time; sith
Charles departed in October, and Henrie in August: by the priuation of whose liues,
which of the two realmes susteined the greater losse, it is a question not to be discussed.
Certeine it is that they were both souereigns tenderlie loued of their subiects, as
they were princes greatlie fauouring their people. Finallie, in memorie of this Henrie
the fift, a king of a roiall hart, and euerie waie indued with imperiall vertues, I
find so fit a report conspiring in truth with his properties and disposition, that I thinke
it verie conuenient here to be inserted in place of an epitaph:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Henrici illustris properans mors occupat artus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ille su&aelig; patri&aelig; decus immortale per &aelig;uum<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Of learned men and writers, these I find remembred by Bale and others, to haue
liued in the daies of this noble and valiant king Henrie the fift. First. Alaine de
Lin, borne in Lin, and professed a Carmelite frier in that towne, he at length
became prior of that conuent, proc&eacute;eded doctor of diuinitie in Cambridge, and wrote
manie treatises; Thomas Otterborne that wrote an historie of England, is thought
to liue about this season, he was a Franciscan or graie frier, as they called them,
a great student both in diuinitie and philosophie: Iohn Seguard an excellent poet,
and a rhetorician, kept a schoole, and read to his scholers in Norwich, as is supposed,
writing sundrie treatises, reproouing as well the profaning of the christian religion
in monks and priests, as the abuse of poetrie in those that tooke vpon them to
write filthie verses and rimes; Robert Rose a frier of the Carmelites order in Norwich
commonlie called the white friers, both an excellent philosopher, and diuine, proc&eacute;eded
doctor at Oxenford, promoted to be prior of his house, and writing diuerse
treatises: amongst all the sophists of his time (as saith Bale) he offended none of
the Wickleuists, who in that season set foorth purelie the word of God, as maie
appeare by his workes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>W. P.</i></div>

<p>Moreouer, Iohn Lucke, a doctor of diuinitie in Oxenford, a sore enimie to the
Wickleuists; Richard Caister borne in Norfolke, vicar of saint Stephans in Norwich,
a man of great holinesse and puritie in life, fauouring (though secretlie) the doctrine
of the Wickleuists, and reproouing in his sermons, the vnchast manners and filthie
example that appeared in the cleargie. Of sir Iohn Oldcastell lord Cobham ye
haue heard before; William Walleis a blacke frier in Lin, and prouinciall of his
order here in England, made a booke of moralizations vpon Ouids Metamorph&ocirc;seis,
comparable to postils vpon Aesops Fables; Richard Snetisham, a student in Oxenford,
where he profited so greatlie in learning and wisedome, that he was accounted the
ch&eacute;efest in all that vniuersitie, in respect whereof he was made chancellor of the
same, chosen also to be one of the twelue to examine and iudge vpon Wickliffes
doctrine by the archbishop of Canturburie; Iohn Langdene a monke of Christes
church in Canturburie, an other of those twelue; William Tailor a priest, and a
master of art in Oxenford, a stedfast follower of Wickliffes doctrine, &amp; burnt for
the same in Smithfield at London, the second day of March, in the yeare of our Lord
1422, &amp; last of king Henrie the fift his reigne.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Richard Grasdale student in Oxenford, one of those twelue also;
William Lindwood a lawier excellentlie learned, as well in the ciuill as canon lawes,
aduanced to the seruice of this king, and made by him k&eacute;eper of the priuie seale, sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
in ambassage both to the kings of Spaine and Portingale, about businesse of most
weightie importance. It is said that he was promoted to the bishoprike of saint
Dauid; Bartholomew Florarius, supposed (as Bale saith) by Nicholas Brigham, to be
an Englishman, wrote a treatise called Florarium, whereof he tooke his surname;
and also an other treatise of abstinence, in which he reprooueth certeine corrupt
manners in the cleargie, and the profession of friers mendicants; Adam Hemmelington,
a Carmelite frier, studied both in Oxenford and Paris; William Batecombe
is placed by Bale about the time of other learned men that liued in this kings
time, he was an excellent mathematician, as by the title of his works which he wrote
it should appeare.</p>

<p>Titus Liuius de Fora Luuisiis liued also in these daies, an Italian borne: but sith he
was both residant here, and wrote the life of this king, I haue thought good to place
him among other of our English writers. One there was that translated the said
historic into English, adding (as it were by waie of notes in manie places of that
booke) sundrie things for the more large vnderstanding of the historie; a copie whereof
I haue s&eacute;ene belonging to Iohn Stow citizen of London. There was also about
the same time an other writer, who (as I remember) hath followed the said Liuius in
the order of his booke, as it were chapter for chapter, onelie changing a good, familiar
and easie stile, which the said Liuius vsed, into a certeine poeticall kind of writing:
a copie whereof I haue s&eacute;ene (&amp; in the life of this king partlie followed) belonging to
master Iohn Twine of Kent, who (as I was informed) meant to leaue to posteritie
some fruits of his labours for the due vnderstanding thereof.</p>

<p class="center">Thus farre Henrie the fift sonne and successor to Henrie the fourth.
